<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> book was written in the spring of 1914, just
before Germany plunged the world into the
horrors of a war which she had long prepared,
taking as a pretext a Balkan incident&mdash;the
political murder of an Austrian prince by an
Austrian subject of Serb nationality. Germany
having prepared for war was anxious for an
occasion which would range Austria by her side.
If Germany had gone to war at the time of the
Agadir incident, she knew that Italy would
desert the Triple Alliance, and she feared for
Austria's loyalty. A war pretext which made
Austria's desertion impossible was just the thing
for her plans.</p>

<p>It would be impossible to reshape this book
so as to bring within its range the Great War,
begun in the Balkans, and in all human probability<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
to be decided finally by battles in the
Balkans. I let it go out to the public as impressions
of the Balkans dated from the end of
1913. It may have some value to the student
of contemporary Balkan events.</p>

<p>My impressions of the Balkan Peninsula were
chiefly gathered during the period 1912-13 of
the war of the Balkan allies against Turkey,
and of the subsequent war among themselves.
I was war correspondent for the London <i>Morning
Post</i> during the war against Turkey and penetrated
through the Balkan Peninsula down to
the Sea of Marmora and the lines of Chatalja.
In war-time peoples show their best or their
worst. As they appeared during a struggle in
which, at first, the highest feelings of patriotism
were evoked, and afterwards the lowest feelings
of greed and cruelty, the Balkan peoples left
me with a steady affection for the peasants and
the common folk generally; a dislike and contempt,
which made few exceptions, for the
politicians and priests who governed their
destinies. Perhaps when they settle down to
a more peaceful existence&mdash;if ever they do&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
inhabitants of the Balkan Peninsula will
come to average more their qualities, the common
people becoming less simple-minded, obedient,
chaste, kind: their leaders learning wisdom
rather than cunning, and getting some sense
of the value of truth and also some sense of
ruth to keep them from setting their countrymen
at one another's throats. But at the
present time the picture which I have to put
before the reader, with its almost unbelievable
contradictions of courage and gentleness on the
one side and cowardly cruelty on the other, is
a true one.</p>

<p>The true Balkan States are Bulgaria, Serbia,
Montenegro, and Albania. Roumania is proud
to consider herself a Western State rather than
a semi-Eastern Balkan State, though both her
position and her diplomacy link her closely with
Balkan developments. Turkey, of course, cannot
be considered in any sense as a Balkan State
though she still holds the foot of the Balkan
Peninsula. Greece has prouder aspirations than
to be considered one of the struggling nationalities
of the Balkans and dreams of a revival of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
the Hellenic Empire. But in considering the
Balkan Peninsula it is not possible to exclude
altogether the Turk, the Greek, the Roumanian.
My aim will be to give a snapshot picture of the
Balkan Peninsula, looking at it as a geographical
entity for historical reference, and to devote more
especial attention to the true Balkan States.</p>

<h2>THE BALKAN PENINSULA</h2>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h4>THE VEXED BALKANS</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Fates were unkind to the Balkan Peninsula.
Because of its position, it was forced to stand in
the path of the greatest racial movements of the
world, and was thus the scene of savage racial
struggles, and the depositary of residual shreds
of nations surviving from great defeats or Pyrrhic
victories and cherishing irreconcilable mutual
hatreds. As if that were not enough of ill fortune
imposed by geographical position, the great Roman
Empire elected to come from its seat in the
Italian Peninsula to die in the Balkan Peninsula,
a long drawn-out death of many agonies, of many
bloody disasters and desperate retrievals. For
all the centuries of which history knows a blood-mist
has hung over the Balkans; and for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
centuries before the dawn of written history one
may surmise that there was the same constant
struggle of warring races.</p>

<p>It seems fairly certain that when the Northern
peoples moved down from their gloomy forests
towards the Mediterranean littoral to mingle
their blood with the early peoples of the Minoan
civilisation and to found the Grecian and the
Roman nations, the chief stream of these fierce
hordes moved down by the valley of the Danube
and debouched on the Balkan Peninsula. Doubtless
they fought many a savage battle with the
aborigines in Thessaly and Thrace. Of these
battles we have no records, and no absolute
certainty, indeed, that the Mediterranean shore
was colonised by a race from the North, though
all the facts that we are learning now from the
researches of modern archaeologists point to that
conclusion. But whatever the prehistoric state
of the Balkan Peninsula, the first sure records
from written history show it as a vexed area
peopled by widely different and mutually
warring races, and subject always to waves of
war and invasion from the outside. The Slav
historian Jire&#269;ek concludes that the Balkan
Peninsula was inhabited at the earliest times<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
known to history by many different tribes
belonging to distinct races&mdash;the Thraco-Illyrians,
the Thraco-Macedonians, and the Thraco-Dacians.
At the beginning of the third century, the Slavs
made their first appearance and, crossing the
Danube, came to settle in the great plains between
the river and the Balkan Mountains. Later, they
proceeded southwards and formed colonies among
the Thraco-Illyrians, the Roumanians, and the
Greeks. This Slav emigration went on for several
centuries. In the seventh century of the Christian
era a Finno-ugric tribe reached the banks of the
Danube. This tribe came from the Volga, and,
crossing Russia, proceeded towards ancient Moesia,
where it took possession of the north-east territory
of the Balkans between the Danube and the
Black Sea. These were the Bulgars or Volgars,
near cousins to the Turks who were to come
later. The Bulgars assumed the language of
the Slavs, and some of their customs. The
Serbs or Serbians, coming from the Don River
district had been near neighbours of the Volgars
or Bulgars (in the Slav languages "B" and "V"
have a way of interchanging), and were without
much doubt closely allied to them in race originally.
Later, they diverged, tending more to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
Slav type, whilst the Bulgars approached nearer
to the Turk type.</p>

<p>There may be traced, then, in the racial history
of the Balkans these race types: a Mediterranean
people inhabiting the sea-coast and possessing a
fairly high civilisation, the records of which are
being explored now in the Cretan excavations;
an aboriginal people occupying the hinterland
of the coast, not so highly cultivated as the
coast dwellers (who had probably been civilised
by Egyptian influences) but racially akin to them;
a Northern people coming from the shores of
the Baltic and the North Sea before the period of
written history and combining ultimately with the
people of the coast to found the Grecian civilisation,
leaving in the hinterland, as they passed
towards the sea, detachments which formed other
mixed tribes, partly aboriginal, partly Nordic;
various invading peoples of Semitic type from
the Levant; the Romans, the Goths and the
Huns, the Slavs and the Tartars, the Bulgars and
the Serbs, the Normans, Saracens, and Turks.
Because the Balkan Peninsula was on the natural
path to a warm-water port from the north to the
south of Europe; because it was on the track
of invasion and counter-invasion between Asia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
and Europe, all this mixture of races was forced
upon it, and as a consequence of the mixture a
constant clash of warfare. There was, too, a
current of more peaceful communication for
purposes of trade between the Levant and the
Black Sea on the one side and the peoples of the
Baltic Sea on the other side, which flowed in part
along the Balkan Peninsula.</p>

<p>In <i>Italy and her Invaders</i> Mr. T. Hodgkin
suggests:</p>

<blockquote><p>During the interval from 540 to 480 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> there was a
brisk commercial intercourse between the flourishing
Greek colonies on the Black Sea, Odessos, Istros, Tyras,
Olbia and Chersonesos&mdash;places now approximately
represented by Varna, Kustendjix, Odessa, Cherson,
and Sebastopol&mdash;between these cities and the tribes to
the northward (inhabiting the country which has been
since known as Lithuania), all of whom at the time of
Herodotus passed under the vague generic name of
Scythians. By this intercourse which would naturally
pass up the valleys of the great rivers, especially the
Dniester and the Dnieper, and would probably again
descend by the Vistula and the Niemen, the settlements
of the Goths were reached, and by its means the Ionian
letter-forms were communicated to the Goths, to
become in due time the magical and mysterious Runes.</p>

<p>One fact which lends great probability to this theory
is that undoubtedly, from very early times, the amber
deposits of the Baltic, to which allusion has already
been made, were known to the civilised world; and thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
the presence of the trader from the South among the
settlements of the Guttones or Goths is naturally
accounted for. Probably also there was for centuries
before the Christian Era a trade in sables, ermines, and
other furs, which were a necessity in the wintry North
and a luxury of kings and nobles in the wealthier South.
In exchange for amber and fur, the traders brought
probably not only golden staters and silver drachmas,
but also bronze from Armenia with pearls, spices, rich
mantles suited to the barbaric taste of the Gothic
chieftains. As has been said, this commerce was most
likely carried on for many centuries. Sabres of Assyrian
type have been found in Sweden, and we may hence
infer that there was a commercial intercourse between
the Euxine and the Baltic, perhaps 1300 years before
Christ.</p></blockquote>

<p>A few leading facts with dates should give a
fairly clear impression of the story of the Balkan
Peninsula. About 400 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> the Macedonian
Empire was being founded. It represented the
uprise of a hinterland Greek people over the
decayed greatness of the coast-dwelling Greeks.
At that time the northern part of the Balkan
Peninsula was occupied by the Getae or Dacians.
Phillip of Macedon made an alliance with the
Getae. Alexander the Great of Macedonia
thrashed them to subjection and carried a great
wave of invasion into Asia from the Balkan
Peninsula.</p>

<span class="caption">TRAJAN&#39;S COLUMN IN ROME<br />
Commemorates the victories which brought all the Balkan Peninsula under
the Roman sway</span>
</div>

<p class="p2">About the year 110 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> the Romans first came
to the Balkan Peninsula, finding it inhabited as
regards the south by the Greek peoples, as
regards the north by the Getae or Dacians. The
southern people were quickly subdued: the
northern people were never really subdued by
the Romans until the time of Trajan (the first
century of the Christian era). He bridged the
Danube with a great military bridge at the spot
now known as Turnu-Severin, and Trajan's
Column in Rome commemorated the victories
which brought all the Balkan Peninsula under the
Roman sway. Trajan found that the manners
and customs of the Dacians were similar to those
of the Germans. These sturdy Dacians were
conquered but not exterminated by the Romans.
Dacia across the Danube was made into a Roman
colony, and the present kingdom of Roumania
is supposed to represent the survival of that
colony, which was a mixture of Roman and
Dacian blood.</p>

<p>In the third century of the Christian era the
Goths made their first appearance in the Balkan
Peninsula. The Roman Empire had then entered
into its period of decline. The invasions of the
Visigoths, the Huns, the Vandals, the Ostrogoths,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
and the Lombards were to come in turn to overwhelm
the Roman civilisation. The Gothic invasion
of the Balkan Peninsula was begun in
the reign of the Roman Emperor Phillip. Crossing
the Danube, the Goths ravaged Thrace and laid
siege to Marcianople (now Schumla) without
success. In a later invasion the Goths attacked
Philippopolis and captured it after a great defeat
of the Roman general, Decius the younger. Then
the Roman Emperor (Decius the elder) himself
took the field and was defeated and killed in
a great battle near the mouth of the Danube
(<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 251). That may be called the decisive
date in the history of the fall of the Roman
Empire. It was destined to retrieve that defeat,
and to shine with momentary glory again for
brief intervals, but the destruction of the Emperor
and his army by the Goths in 251 was the
sure presage of the doom of the Roman Power.</p>

<p>One direct result of the battle in which Decius
was slain was to bring the headquarters of the
Roman Empire to the Balkan Peninsula. It
was found that a better stand could be made
against the tide of Gothic invasion from a new
capital closer to the Scythian frontier. Constantinople
was planned and built, and became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
the capital of the Roman Empire (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 330), and
thus brought to the Balkan stage the death throes
of the mightiest world-power that history has
known. From that date it is wise for the sake
of clearness to speak of the Roman Empire as
the Greek Empire, though it was some time after
its settlement in Constantinople before it became
rather Greek than Roman in character.</p>

<p>With the issue between the Goths and the
Greek Empire, in which peaceful agreements often
interrupted for a while fierce campaigns, I cannot
deal here at any length. It soaked the Balkan
Peninsula deep in blood. But it was only the
first of the horrors that were to mark the death
of the Empire. Late in the fourth century of
the Christian Era there burst into the Balkans
from the steppes of Astrakhan and the Caucasus&mdash;from
very much the same district that was afterwards
to supply the Bulgars and the Serbs&mdash;the
Tartar hordes of the Huns. Of these Huns there
is a vivid contemporary Gothic account.</p>

<blockquote><p class="p2b">We have ascertained that the nation of the Huns,
who surpassed all others in atrocity, came thus into
being. When Filimer, fifth king of the Goths after
their departure from Sweden, was entering Scythia,
with his people, as we have before described, he found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
among them certain sorcerer-women, whom they called
in their native tongue Haliorunnas (or Al-runas), whom
he suspected and drove forth from the midst of his
army into the wilderness. The unclean spirits that
wander up and down in desert places, seeing these
women, made concubines of them; and from this union
sprang that most fierce people [of the Huns], who were
at first little, foul, emaciated creatures, dwelling among
the swamps, and possessing only the shadow of human
speech by way of <a id="language"></a>language.</p>

</div>
<p class="p2">With the Alani especially, who were as good warriors
as themselves, but somewhat less brutal in appearance
and manner of life, they had many a struggle, but at
length they wearied out and subdued them. For, in
truth, they derived an unfair advantage from the intense
hideousness of their countenances. Nations whom
they would never have vanquished in fair fight fled
horrified from those frightful&mdash;faces I can hardly call
them, but rather&mdash;shapeless black collops of flesh, with
little points instead of eyes. No hair on their cheeks
or chins gives grace to adolescence or dignity to age, but
deep furrowed scars instead, down the sides of their
faces, show the impress of the iron which with characteristic
ferocity they apply to every male child that
is born among them, drawing blood from its cheeks
before it is allowed its first taste of milk. They are
little in stature, but lithe and active in their motions,
and especially skilful in riding, broad-shouldered, good
at the use of the bow and arrows, with sinewy necks,
and always holding their heads high in their pride. To
sum up, these beings under the form of man hide the
fierce nature of the beast!</p></blockquote>

<p>Not a lovable people the Huns clearly:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
and the modern peoples who have some slight
ancestral kinship with them hate to be reminded
of the fact. I remember the fierce indignation
which a French war correspondent aroused in
Bulgarian breasts by his description&mdash;which had
eluded the censor&mdash;of the passage of a great
Bulgarian train of ox wagons because he compared
it to the passage of the Huns.</p>

<p>The Huns were, with the exception of the
Persians who had vainly attacked the Greek
States at an earlier period, the first successful
Asiatic invaders of Europe. For a full century
they ravaged the Empire, and the Balkan
Peninsula felt the chief force of their barbarian
rage. By the fifth century the waves of the Hun
invasions had died away, leaving distinct traces of
the Hunnish race in the Balkans. The Gepidae,
the Lombards, and later the Hungarians and the
Tartars then took up the task of ravaging the
unhappy land which as the chief seat of power of
the Greek Empire found itself the first objective
of every invader because of that dignity and yet
but poorly protected by that power. Constantinople
was never taken by these barbarians, but
at some periods little else than its walls stood
secure against their ravages.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile the first Saracens had appeared
in the Peninsula, curiously enough not as invaders
nor as enemies, but as mercenary soldiers in the
army of the Greek Empire fighting against the
Goths. To a Gothic chronicler we are again
indebted for a vivid picture of these Saracens,
"riding almost naked into battle, their long
black hair streaming in the wind, wont to spring
with a melancholy howl upon their chosen victim
in battle and to suck his life-blood, biting at his
throat." Perhaps the Gothic war correspondent
of the day studied picturesqueness more than
accuracy, like some of his modern successors.
But, without a doubt, the first contact with
Asiatics, whether Huns or Saracens, gave to the
European peoples a horror and a terror which
had never been inspired by their battles among
themselves&mdash;battles by no means bloodless or
merciful. As the Asiatic waves of invasion later
developed in strength the unhappy Balkan
Peninsula was doomed to feel their full force as
they poured across the Bosphorus from Asia
Minor, and across the Danube from the north-eastern
Asiatic steppes.</p>

<p>It would be vain to attempt to chronicle even
in the barest outline all the horrors inflicted upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
the Balkans from the date of the first invasion
of the Huns in the fourth century to the first
invasion of the Turks in the fourteenth century.
To say that those ten centuries were filled with
bloodshed suffices. But they also saw the
development of the Balkan nationalities of to-day,
and cannot therefore be passed over without
some attention. Let us then glance at each
Balkan nation during that period.</p>

<p><i>Roumania</i>, inhabited by the people of the old
Roman-Dacian colony, stood full in the way of
the Northern invasions of Goths, of Huns, of
Hungarians, of Tartars. It was almost submerged.
But in the thirteenth century the
country benefited by the coming of Teutonic
and Norman knights. The two kingdoms or
principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia (which,
combined, make up modern Roumania) were
founded in this century.</p>

<p><i>Bulgaria.</i>&mdash;In the seventh century Slavs had
begun to settle in Bulgaria. The Bulgars or
Volgars followed. They were akin to the Tartars
and the Turks. Together Slavs and Bulgars
formed the Bulgarian national type and founded
a very robust nation which was almost constantly
at war with the Greek Empire (with its capital<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
at Constantinople). At times Bulgaria seriously
threatened Constantinople and the Greek
Empire. A boastful inscription in the Church
of the Forty Martyrs at Tirnovo, the ancient
capital of Bulgaria, records:</p>

<blockquote><p>In the year 1230, I, John As&#xEA;n, Czar and Autocrat
of the Bulgarians, obedient to God in Christ, son of the
old As&#xEA;n, have built this most worthy church from its
foundations, and completely decked it with paintings
in honour of the Forty holy Martyrs, by whose help,
in the 12th year of my reign, when the Church had just
been painted, I set out to Roumania to the war and
smote the Greek army and took captive the Czar Theodore
Komnenus with all his nobles. And all lands have
I conquered from Adrianople to Durazzo, the Greek, the
Albanian, and the Serbian land. Only the towns round
Constantinople and that city itself did the Franks hold;
but these too bowed themselves beneath the hand of
my sovereignty, for they had no other Czar but me, and
prolonged their days according to my will, as God had
so ordained. For without him no word or work is
accomplished. To him be honour for ever. Amen.</p></blockquote>

<p>The wars were carried on under conditions
of mutual ferocity which still rule in Bulgarian-Grecian
conflicts. An incident of one campaign
was that the Greek Emperor, Basil, the Bulgar-slayer,
having captured a Bulgarian army, had
the eyes torn out of all the men and sent them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
home blinded, leaving, however, one eye to every
centurion, so that the poor mutilated wretches
might have guides. In the early part of the
fourteenth century a Bulgarian Czar, Michael,
almost captured Constantinople. He formed a
league with the Roumanians and the Greeks
against the Serbs, who were at the time promising
to become the paramount power of the peninsula.
But Czar Michael was defeated by the Serbs and
Bulgaria became dependent upon Serbia, which
was the position of affairs at the time of the
first serious Turkish invasion of the Balkan
Peninsula.</p>

<p><i>Serbia.</i>&mdash;Invading tribes of Don Cossacks began
to come in great numbers to the Balkan Peninsula
in the sixth century. In the seventh century
they were encouraged by the Greek Empire to
settle in Serbia, on condition of paying tribute
to Constantinople. They set up a kind of aristocratic
republic of a Slav type. In the ninth
century they began to fight with the neighbouring
and kindred Bulgarians. Early in the tenth
century (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 917) the Bulgarians almost effaced
Serbia from the map; but the Serbs recovered after
half a century, only to come shortly afterwards
under the sway of the Greeks. In the eleventh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
century the Serbians held a very strong position
and were able to harass the Greek Empire at
Constantinople. They entered into friendly
relations with the Pope of Rome, and for some
time contemplated following the Roman rather
than the Eastern Church. In the twelfth century
King Stephen of Serbia was a valued ally of
the Greek Empire against the Venetians. He
established Serbia as a European "Power," and
the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa visited his
court at Belgrade. This king was the first of
a succession of able and brave monarchs, and
Serbia enjoyed a period of stable prosperity and
power unusually lengthy for the Balkans. Except
for the strife between the Eastern and Roman
Catholic Churches for supremacy in Serbia, the
nation was at peace within her own borders, and
enjoyed not only a military but an economic
predominance in the Balkans. Mining and handicrafts
were developed, education encouraged,
and the national organisation reached fully to
the average standard of European civilisation
at the time. By 1275 the Serbs were the chief
power in the Balkans. They defeated the Greeks,
marched right down to the Aegean and reached
the famous monastery of Mount Athos, to which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
the first King Stephen (Nemanya) had retired
in 1195 when he abdicated.</p>

<p class="p4b">In 1303 the Serbians forgot their quarrel with
the Greeks and helped them against the Turks,
undertaking an invasion of Asia Minor. In 1315
they again saved the Greek Empire from the
Turks. When in 1336 Stephen Dushan, the
greatest of Serbian kings, who has been compared
to Napoleon because of his military genius and
capacity for statesmanship, came to the throne,
Bulgaria was under the suzerainty of Serbia, and
the Serb monarch ruled over all that area comprised
within the boundaries of Bulgaria, Serbia,
Albania, Montenegro, and Greece by the recent
treaty of Bucharest (1913). King Stephen
Dushan was not only a great military leader, he
was also a law-maker and a patron of learning.
His death on December 13, 1356, at the Gates of
Constantinople&mdash;he is said to have been poisoned&mdash;opened
the way for the Turkish occupation
of the Balkan Peninsula. That occupation was
made possible in the first instance by the mutual
jealousies of the Christian peoples of the Balkans.
It was kept in existence for centuries by the same
weaknesses arising from jealousy. In 1912 it
was swept away in a month because in a spasm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
of common sense the Balkan Christian peoples
had united. In 1913 it was in part restored
because internecine strife had broken out again
among the Balkan natives recently allied. It
will probably continue until the lesson of unity
is learned again.</p>

<h2 class="high">CHAPTER II</h2>

<h4>THE TURK IN THE BALKANS</h4>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">It</span> seems to be difficult to speak without violent
prejudice on the subject of the Turk in the
Balkans. One school of prejudice insists that
the Turk is the finest gentleman in the world,
who has been always the victim and not the
oppressor of the Christian peoples by whose side
he lives, and whose territories he invaded with
the best of motives and with the minimum of
slaughter. The other school of prejudice credits
the Turk with the most abominable cruelty,
treachery, and lust, and will hear no good of
him. In England the issue is largely a political
one. A great Liberal campaign was once founded
on a Turkish massacre of Bulgarians in the
Balkans. That made it a party duty for Liberals
to be pro-Bulgarian and anti-Turk, and almost
a party duty for Conservatives to find all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
Christian and a few ex-Christian virtues in the
Turk. Before attempting to judge the Turk of
to-day, let us see how he stands in the light of
history. It was in the fourth century that the
first Saracens came to the Balkan Peninsula as
allies of the Greek Empire against the Goths.
They were thus called in by a Christian Power
in the first instance. It was not until the
fourteenth century that the Turks made a serious
attempt to occupy the Balkan Peninsula. They
were helped in their campaign considerably by
the Christian Crusaders, who, incidentally to
their warfare against the Infidel who held the
Holy Sepulchre, had made war on the Greek
Empire, capturing Constantinople, and thus weakening
the power of Christian Europe at its
threshold. Bulgaria, too, refused help to the
Greeks when the Turkish invasion had to be
beaten off. The Turks' coming to the Balkans
was thus largely due to Christian divisions.</p>

mosque 1453. It is now thought that the design of its famous architect,
Anthemius of Tralles, was never completed. The minarets and most of the
erections in the foreground are Turkish</p>
</div>

<p class="p2">Without being able at the time to capture
Constantinople, the invading Turks occupied
soon a large tract of the Balkan Peninsula. By
1362 they had captured Philippopolis and Eski
Zagora, two important centres of Bulgaria. It
was not a violence to their conscience for some
of the Bulgarian men after this to join the Turkish
army as mercenaries. When the sorely-beset
Greeks sent the Emperor John Paleologos to
appeal for help to the Bulgarians, he was seized
by them and kept as a prisoner.</p>

<p>A united Balkan Peninsula would have kept
off the Turks, no doubt. But a set of small
nations without any faculty of permanent cohesion,
and hating and distrusting one another
more thoroughly than they did the Turk, could
do nothing. The Balkan nations of the time,
though united they would have been really
powerful, allowed themselves to be taken in
detail and crushed under the heels of an invader
who was alien in blood and in religion. In 1366
the Bulgarians became the vassals of the Turks,
and the Serbians were defeated at Kossovo. The
fall of the Greek Empire and the subjugation of
Roumania followed in due course, and by the
seventeenth century the Turks had penetrated
to the very walls of Vienna. At one time it
seemed as if all Europe would fall under the
sway of Islam, for, as elsewhere than in the
Balkans, there were Christian States which were
treacherous to their faith. But that happily was
averted. For the Balkan Peninsula, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
there were now to be centuries of oppression
and religious persecution. It will be convenient
once again to set forth under three national
headings the chief facts regarding the Turkish
conquest of the Balkans.</p>

<p><i>Bulgaria.</i>&mdash;By 1366 weakness in the field and
civil dissensions had brought Bulgaria to the
humiliation of becoming the vassal of the Turk.
In 1393 the Turks, not content with mere suzerainty,
occupied Bulgaria and converted it into
a Turkish province. In 1398 the Hungarians
and the Wallachians (Roumanians) made a gallant
attempt to free Bulgaria from the Turkish yoke,
but failed. Some of the Bulgarians joined in
with their Turkish conquerors, abandoned the
Christian religion for that of Islam, and were the
ancestors of what are known to-day as the
Pomaks. The rest of the people gave a reluctant
obedience to the Turkish conqueror, preserving
their Christian faith, their Slav tongue, and their
sense of separate nationality. The Greeks, who
had come to some kind of terms with the Turkish
invaders, assisted to bring the Bulgarian people
under subjection. The Greek church and the
Greek tongue rather than the Turkish were
sought to be imposed upon the Bulgarians. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
subject people accepted the situation with occasional
revolts, but more tamely than some other
Balkan nations. It was not a general meek
acquiescence, though it was&mdash;possibly by chance,
possibly because of the fact that a racial relationship
existed between conqueror and conquered&mdash;not
so fierce in protest as that of the Serbians.
In writing that, I do not follow exactly the Bulgarian
modern view, which represents as much
more vivid the sufferings and the protests of the
Bulgarian people, and ignores altogether the
racial relationship which existed between Bulgarian
and Turk, and enabled a section of the
Bulgarian nation to fall into line with the conqueror
and embrace his religion and his habits
of life, a relationship which to this day shows
its traces in the Bulgarian national life. But in
Balkan history as written locally, there is usually
a certain amount of political deflection from
the facts. A modern Balkan historian, giving
what may be called the official national account
of the times of the Turkish domination, says
(<i>Bulgaria of To-day</i>):</p>

<blockquote><p>Had the rulers been of the same race and religion as
the vanquished, the subjection might have been more
tolerable. Ottoman domination was not, however, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
simple political domination. Ottoman tyranny was
social as well as political. It was keenly and painfully
felt in private as well as in public life; in social liberty,
manners and morals; in the free development of national
feeling; in short, in the whole scope of human life.
According to our present notions, political domination
does not infringe upon personal liberty, which is sacred
for the conqueror. This is not the case with Turkish
rule. The Bulgarians, like the other Christians of the
Balkan Peninsula, were, both collectively and individually,
slaves. The life, possessions, and honour of
private individuals were in constant peril. The bulk
of the people, after several generations, calmed down
to passivity and inertia. From time to time the more
vigorous element, the strongest individualities, protested.
Some Bulgarian whose sister had been carried
off to the harem of some pasha would take to the
mountains and make war on the oppressors. The
haidukes and voivodes, celebrated in the national songs,
kept up in mountain fastnesses that spirit of liberty
which later was to serve as a cement to unite the new
Bulgarian nation.</p>

<p>But it is a noteworthy fact that the Osmanlis, being
themselves but little civilised, did not attempt to assimilate
the Bulgarians in the sense in which civilised
nations try to effect the intellectual and ethnic assimilation
of a subject race. Except in isolated cases, where
Bulgarian girls or young men were carried off and forced
to adopt Mohammedanism, the government never took
any general measures to impose Mohammedanism or
assimilate the Bulgarians to the Moslems. The Turks
prided themselves on keeping apart from the Bulgarians,
and this was fortunate for our nationality. Contented
with their political supremacy and pleased to feel themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
masters, the Turks did not trouble about the
spiritual life of the <i>rayas</i>, except to try to trample out
all desires for independence. All these circumstances
contributed to allow the Bulgarian people, crushed and
ground down by the Turkish yoke, to concentrate and
preserve its own inner spiritual life. They formed religious
communities attached to the churches. These
had a certain amount of autonomy, and, beside seeing
after the churches, could keep schools. The national
literature, full of the most poetic melancholy, handed
down from generation to generation and developed by
tradition, still tells us of the life of the Bulgarians under
the Ottoman yoke. In these popular songs, the memory
of the ancient Bulgarian kingdom is mingled with
the sufferings of the present hour. The songs of this
period are remarkable for the oriental character of
their times, and this is almost the sole trace of Moslem
influence.</p>

<p>In spite of the vigilance of the Turks, the religious
associations served as centres to keep alive the national
feeling.</p></blockquote>

<p>A conquered people which was allowed to
keep up its religious institutions (with "a certain
amount of autonomy"), and later to found
national schools ("to keep alive the national
feeling"), was not exactly ground to the dust.
And truth compels the admission that Bulgaria
under Turkish rule enjoyed a certain amount
of material prosperity. When the Russian
liberators of the nineteenth century came to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
Bulgaria they found the peasants far more
comfortable than were the Russian peasants of
the day. The atrocities in Bulgaria which
shocked Europe in 1875 were not the continuance
of a settled policy of cruelty and rapine. They
were the ferocious reprisals chiefly of Turkish
Bashi-Bazouks (irregulars) following upon a Bulgarian
rising. The Turks felt that they had been
making an honest effort to promote the interests
of the Bulgarian province. They had just satisfied
a Bulgarian aspiration by allowing of the
formation of an independent Bulgarian church,
though this meant giving grave offence to the
Greeks. Probably they felt that they had a real
grievance against the Bulgars. After the Bulgarian
atrocities of 1875 there ended the Turkish
domination of the country.</p>

<p><i>Serbia.</i>&mdash;In December 1356 the great Serbian
king, Stephen Dushan, soldier, administrator, and
economist, died before the walls of Constantinople,
and the one hope of the Balkan Peninsula making
a stand against the Turks was ended. Shortly
after, the Turks had occupied Adrianople, their
first capital in Europe, defeating heavily a
combined Serbian and Greek army. Later the
Serbian forces were again defeated by the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
Turkish sultan Amurath I., and the Serbian king
was killed on the battle-field. King Lazar, who
succeeded to the Serbian throne, made some
headway against the invaders, but in 1389, at
the Battle of Kossovo, the Serbian Empire came
tumbling to ruins. The Turkish leader, Amurath,
was killed in the fight, but his son Bajayet
proved another Amurath and pressed home the
victory. Serbia became a vassal state of Turkey.</p>

<p>But there was to be still a period of fierce
resistance to the Turk. In 1413 the Turks,
dissatisfied with the attitude of the Serbs, entered
upon a new invasion of the territory of
Serbia. In 1440 Sultan Amurath II. again overran
the country and conquered it definitely,
imposing not merely vassalage but armed occupation
on its people. John Hunyad, "the White
Knight of Wallachia," came to the rescue of the
Serbs, and Amurath II. was driven back. An
alliance between Serbs and Hungarians kept the
Turk at bay for a time, and in 1444 Serbia could
claim to be free once again. But the respite was
a brief one. In 1453 Constantinople fell to the
Turks, and the full tide of their strengthened
and now undivided power was turned upon
Serbia. A siege of Belgrade in 1457 was repulsed,
but in 1459 Serbia was conquered and annexed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
to European Turkey. Lack of unity among the
Serbs themselves had contributed greatly to the
national doom, but on the whole the Serbs had
put up a gallant fight against the Turks. And
even now a section of them, the Montenegrins,
in their mountain fastnesses kept their liberty,
and through all the centuries that were to follow
never yielded to the Crescent.</p>

<p class="p2b">The condition of the Serbs in the fifteenth and
sixteenth centuries was very unhappy. They
could come to no manner of contentment with
Turkish rule, and sporadic revolts were frequent.
At times the Hungarians from the other side of
the Danube came to the aid of the revolters, but
never in such strength as to shake seriously the
Turkish power. Very many of the Serbs left
their country in despair and sought refuge under
the Austrian flag. To-day a big Serb element,
under the flag of Austro-Hungaria, is one of the
racial difficulties of the Dual <a id="Monarchy"></a>Monarchy.</p>

<p class="p2">The Serb exiles carried to their new homes
their old sympathies, and largely because of
their efforts Austria in 1788 went to the rescue
of Serbia, and for a brief while the land again
was free. But the Turkish power returned and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
Serbia stumbled blindly, painfully through years
of reprisals, which culminated in the great
massacre of Serbs by Turks in 1804, which, like
the Turkish massacre of Bulgarians in 1875,
really declared the doom of the Turkish power
in the country. Following this massacre George
Petrovic, "Black George," or "<i>Kara</i> George,"
as the Serbians knew him, raised the standard
of revolt among his countrymen. He was a fierce
blood-stained man, this first liberator of the Serbs,
a man on whose head was the blood of his father
and his brother. His grim character was fitted
for his grim task. The story of that task will
come better within the scope of a following
chapter, which will tell of the liberation of the
Balkans from the Turks.</p>

<p><i>Roumania.</i>&mdash;It was not until 1391 that the
Turks crossed the Danube and attacked the
kingdoms of Wallachia and Moldavia, and reduced
Wallachia to the position of a tributary
state. King Mirtsched made a gallant fight
against the invaders, but the Turks proved too
strong. That was the beginning of a Turkish
dominance of Roumania, which was never so
complete as that exercised over Bulgaria and
Serbia, but left the two Roumanian kingdoms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
of Wallachia and Moldavia as vassal states.
Mutual jealousy between them prevented effective
operations against the Turk, and helped to make
their vassalage possible. In the fifteenth century
both kingdoms had great rulers. Wallachia was
ruled by Vlad the Impaler, an able but cruel man,
who seems to have earned the infamy of inventing
a form of torture still practised in the Balkans
as a matter of religious proselytising, that of
sitting the victim on a sharp stake, and leaving
him to die slowly as the stake penetrated his
body. Moldavia had as king Stephen the
Great, who has no such ghastly reputation of
cruelty. But able princes could effect little with
communities weakened by the luxury of the
nobles and the helpless poverty of the serfs.
Still, the Roumanians had intervals of victory.
In the sixteenth century Michael the Brave
(whose memory is commemorated by a statue in
Bucharest) drove the Turks back as far as
Adrianople, liberating Roumania and Bulgaria.
He annexed Moldavia and Transylvania to Wallachia,
and was in a sense the founder of modern
Roumania. But the union thus effected was
not enduring and the Turkish ascendancy grew
stronger. The Turkish suzerain forced upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
Roumanian peoples governors of the Greek race,
who carried on the work of oppression and
spoliation with an industrious effectiveness quite
beyond the capacity of the Turk, who at his worst
is a fitful and indolent tyrant.</p>

<p>In the last quarter of the seventeenth century
the Russian Power began to take a close interest
in Roumania. In 1711 there was a definite
Russian-Roumanian alliance. By this time the
Roumanians were resolutely hostile to the Turkish
domination. True, they had been spared most
of the cruelties which were in Servia a customary
and in Bulgaria an occasional concomitant of
Turkish rule. But they were deeply injured by
the corrupt, the luxurious, the exacting administration
of the Greek rulers forced upon them by
the Turkish government. Though they suffered
little from massacre they suffered much from
"squeeze." There was not only the greed of
the Turk but the greed of the intermediate Greek
to be satisfied. From 1711 until the final
liberation of Roumania, Roumanian sympathies
were generally with the Russians in the frequent
wars waged by them against Turkey. In 1770
the Russians occupied Roumania and freed it
for a time from the Turk, but in 1774 the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
Roumanians went back to the Turkish suzerainty.
During the Napoleonic wars Russia gave Roumania
some reason to doubt the disinterestedness
of her friendship by annexing the rich province
of Bessarabia, a part of the natural territory of
the Roumanian people. The year 1821 saw the
outbreak of the Greek war of independence, in
which Roumania took no part, having as little
love for the Greek as for the Turk. She won one
advantage for herself from the war, the right to
have her native rulers under Turkish suzerainty.
In 1828, as a result of a Russo-Turkish war,
Roumania won almost complete freedom, conditional
only on tribute being continued to be
paid to the Sultan. She found a new master,
however, in Russia, and was forced to keep up a
Russian garrison within her borders, nominally
as a protection against Turkey, really as a safeguard
against the growth in her own people of
a spirit of national independence. The Crimean
War (1853) freed Roumania from this Russian
garrison, and in 1856 the Treaty of Paris declared
Roumania to be an independent principality
under Turkish suzerainty.</p>

<p class="centerb">KING NICOLAS OF MONTENEGRO</p>
</div>

<p class="p2"><i>Montenegro.</i>&mdash;The existence of Montenegro
as a separate Balkan state dates back to the
Battle of Kossovo. The Montenegrin is a Serbian
Highlander, and whilst the Serbian Empire
flourished, claimed for himself no separate national
entity. When, however, the rest of Serbia was
subjugated by the Turks, "the Black Mountain"
held out, and there gathered within its little area
of rocky hill fastnesses the free remnants of the
Serbian race. The story of that little nation is
quite the most wonderful in all the world. It
transcends Sparta, and makes the fighting record
of the Swiss seem tame. At the height of its
power Montenegro had a population of perhaps
8000 males, and little source of riches from mines,
from trade, or even from fertile agricultural
land. Yet Montenegro kept the Turks from her
own territory, and was able at times to give
valuable help to the rest of Europe in withstanding
the invasion of Islam.</p>

<p>The system of government instituted was
that of a theocratic despotism: the head of the
nation was its chief bishop, and he had the right
to nominate a nephew (not a son&mdash;as a bishop of
the Greek Communion he would be celibate)
to succeed him. The Montenegrin dynasty was
founded in 1696 by King Danilo I., and has
endured to this day, though recently the functions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
of the chief priest and king have been separated,
and the present monarch is purely a civil ruler.</p>

<p class="p2b">It is not possible here to give even the barest
mention of the leading facts in the proud history
of little Montenegro. In the seventeenth century
she was the valued friend of Venice against the
Turks; in the eighteenth century she was aided
by Peter the Great of Russia; later she met without
being subdued the warlike power of Napoleon.
All the time, during every century, every year
almost, there was constant warfare with the Turks.
One campaign lasted without interruption from
1424 to 1436, and was marked by over sixty
battles. The little population of the patch of
rocks in the mountains was worn down by this
incessant fighting, but was recruited by a steady
flow of exiles from other parts of the Balkan
Peninsula, anxious for freedom and for revenge
on the Turk. Sometimes the tide of battle went
sorely against the mountaineers, and almost all
their country was put under the heel of the
Moslem. But always one eyrie was kept for the
free eagles, and from it they swooped down with
renewed strength to send the invader once again
across their borders. Repeatedly the Turk levied
great armies for the conquest of Montenegro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
(once the Turkish force reached to the number
of 80,000). Repeatedly great European Powers
which had proffered help or had been begged for
help failed little Montenegro at a crisis. But never
were the stout hearts of the Black Mountain
quelled. In 1484, when Zablak had to be
evacuated and the whole nation was confined to
the little mountain fortress of Cettinje, Ivan the
Black offered to his people the choice of ending
the war and making peace with the Turks. They
rejected the idea, and swore to stand by the
freedom of Montenegro until the last. The oath
was never broken. Right down to 1832 a free
Montenegro faced Turkey. In that year the
Turks, despairing of an occupation of the country,
suggested that Montenegro should agree at least
to pay tribute. That offer was rejected and yet
another war entered upon. A war against Austria
followed, in which the desperate Montenegrins
used the type of their printing presses to make
bullets for the <a id="soldiers"></a>soldiers.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 398px;">

<p class="center"><span class="caption">MONTENEGRIN TROOPS</span></p>

<p class="centerb">Weekly Drill and Inspection of Weapons</p>
</div>

<p class="p2">That there was lead type to be so used
shows that the Montenegrins had not altogether
neglected the arts of peace. In 1493 a printing
press had been set up in Cettinje and the first
Montenegrin book printed in the Cyrillic character.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
During the next century this printing
press was kept busy with the issue of the Gospels
and psalters under the rule of the brave Bishop
Babylas. The state of Montenegro at this time
aroused the admiration of the Venetians, and
there is extant a book in praise of Montenegro
written in 1614 by a Venetian noble, Mariano
Bolizza.</p>

<p>When the time came for the other Balkan
States to throw off the Turkish yoke Montenegro
was not reluctant to join in the movement for
liberation, and she was later first in the field
in the campaign of 1912.</p>

<p class="p2b">This very brief record of the leading facts of
Balkan history has now brought each of the
peoples up to the stage at which the final and
successful effort was made with the help of
Russia to drive the Turks out of Balkan territory.
The story of that effort will be told in the succeeding
chapter.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h4>THE FALL OF THE TURKISH POWER</h4>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">In</span> the nineteenth century the Turkish dominion
was pushed back in all directions from the
Balkan Peninsula. At the dawn of that century
Montenegro was the only Balkan state entirely
free from occupation, vassalage, or the duty of
tribute to the Sublime Porte. At the close of
that century Montenegro, Serbia, Roumania,
Greece, and Bulgaria were all practically free
and self-governing.</p>

<p>In 1804, as has been recorded, Kara George
in Serbia raised the standard of revolt against
Turkey. In 1806 the Serbs defeated the Turks
in a pitched battle, and for a moment Serbia was
free. But in 1812 when the Turkish power
resolved upon a great invasion of Serbia, the heart
of Kara George failed him and he left his country
to its fate, taking refuge in Austria. Thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
deserted by their leader, the Serbs did not abandon
the struggle altogether. Milosh Obrenovic stepped
to the front as the national champion, and though
he could make no stand against the Turkish
troops in the open field he kept up an active
revolt from a base in the mountains. The
contest for national liberty went on with varying
fortune. Troubles at this time were thickening
around Turkey, and whenever she was engaged
in war with Russia the oppressed nationalities
within her borders took the opportunity to strike
a blow for liberty. By 1839&mdash;it is not possible
to make a record of all the dynastic changes
and revolutions which filled the years 1812-1839&mdash;Serbia
was practically free, with the payment
of an annual tribute to Turkey as her only bond.
During the Crimean War she kept her neutrality
as between Russia and Turkey. The Treaty of
Paris (1856) confirmed her territorial independence,
subject to the payment of a tribute to
Turkey. In 1867 the Turkish garrisons were
withdrawn from Serbia; but the tribute was
still left in existence until the date of the Treaty
of Berlin.</p>
<p class="p2b"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p class="ralign"><span class="caption"><i>Exclusive News Agency</i></span></p>

<p class="centerb">THE KING OF ROUMANIA</p>
</div>

<p class="p2">
Roumania in 1828 (then Wallachia and
Moldavia) had won her territorial independence
of Turkey subject only to payment of a tribute.
The Treaty of Paris (1856) left her under a
nominal suzerainty to Turkey. In 1859 the
two kingdoms united to form Roumania, and in
1866 the late King Charles, as the result of
a revolution, was elected prince of the united
kingdom.</p>

<p>Bulgaria had remained a fairly contented
Turkish province until the rising of 1875, and its
cruel suppression by the Bashi-Bazouks. As a
direct consequence of that massacre European
diplomacy turned its serious attention to the
Balkan Peninsula, and at a Conference demands
were made upon Turkey for a comprehensive
reform applying to Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia,
Herzegovina, and Bulgaria. The proposed
reform was particularly drastic as applied
to Bulgaria, which was still in effect Turkish
territory, whilst all the other districts had
achieved a practical freedom. It was proposed
to create two Bulgarian provinces divided into
Sandjaks and Kazas as administrative units,
these to be subdivided into districts. Christian
and Mohammedans were to be settled homogeneously
in these districts. Each district was
to have at its head a mayor and a district council,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
elected by universal suffrage, and was to enjoy
entire autonomy in local affairs. Several districts
would form a Sandjak with a prefect (<i>mutessarif</i>)
at its head who was to be Christian or Mohammedan,
according to the majority of the population
of the Sandjak. He would be proposed by
the Governor-General, and nominated by the
Porte for four years. Finally, every two Sandjaks
were to be administered by a Christian Governor-General
nominated by the Porte for five years,
with consent of the Powers. He would govern
the province with the help of a provincial assembly,
composed of representatives chosen by the district
councils for a term of four years. This assembly
would nominate an administrative council. The
provincial assembly would be summoned every
year to decide the budget and the redivision of
taxes. The armed force was to be concentrated
in the towns and there would be local militia
besides. The language of the predominant
nationality was to be employed, as well as
Turkish. Finally, a Commission of International
Control was to supervise the execution of these
reforms.</p>

<p class="p2b">The Sublime Porte was still haggling about
these reforms when Russia lost patience and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
declared war upon Turkey on April 12, 1877.
Moving through the friendly territory of
Roumania, Russia attacked the Turkish forces
in Bulgarian territory. In that war the Russians
found that the Turks were a gallant foe, and
the issue seemed to hang in the balance until
Roumania and Bulgaria went actively to the
help of the Russian forces. The Roumanian
aid was exceedingly valuable. Prince Charles
crossed the Danube at the head of 28,000 foot
soldiers and 4000 cavalry. He was appointed
Commander-in-Chief of the forces against Plevna,
and his soldiers were chiefly responsible for the
taking of the Grivica Redoubt which turned the
tide of victory against the Turks. The Bulgarians
did but little during the campaign: it was not
possible that they should do much seeing that
they could only put irregulars in the field. Nevertheless
some high personal reputations for courage
were made. During my stay with the Bulgarian
army in 1912 I noted that there were of the
military officers three classes, the men who had
graduated in foreign military colleges&mdash;usually
Petrograd,&mdash;very smart, very insistent on
their military dignity, speaking usually three or
four languages; officers who had been educated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
at the Military College, Sofia; and the older
Bulgarian type, dating sometimes from before
the War of Liberation. Of these last the outstanding
figure was General Nicolaieff, who as captain
of a Bulgarian company rushed a Turkish battery
beneath Shipka after the Russians had been held
up so long that they were in despair. A fine
stalwart figure General Nicolaieff showed when
I met him at Yamboli, a hospital base town of
which he was military commandant. Another
soldier of the War of Liberation, a captain in rank,
I travelled with for a day once between Kirk
Kilisse and Chorlu. We chummed up and shared
a meal of meat balls cooked with onions, rough
country wine (these from his stores), and dates
and biscuits (from my stores). He spoke neither
English nor French, but a Bulgarian doctor
who spoke French acted as interpreter, and the
old officer, who after long entreaty at last had
got leave to go down to the front in spite of his
age, yarned about the hardships and tragedies of
the fighting around Stara Zagora and the Shipka
Pass. Some of the Bulgarians, he said, took
the field with no other arms than staves and
knives, and got their first rifles from the dead of
the battle-<a id="fields"></a>fields.</p>

</div>

<p class="p2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
Serbia took a hand in this campaign, too,
though she hesitated for some time, going to the
aid of Russia through fear of Austria. Beginning
late, at a time when the mountains were covered
in the winter snows, the Serbians suffered severely
from the weather, but won notable victories
at Pirot, at Nish, and at Vranga. The Turks
were in full retreat on Constantinople when the
armistice and Treaty of San Stefano put an end
to the war.</p>

<p>It seems to be one of the standing rules of
Balkan wars and Balkan peace treaties that
those who do the work shall not reap the reward,
and that a policy of standing by and waiting is
the wisest and most profitable. In this Russo-Turkish
war the Roumanians had done invaluable
work for the Russian cause. In return the
Treaty of San Stefano robbed them shamefully.
The Bulgarians had done little, except to stain
the arms of the allies with a series of massacres
of the Turks in reprisal for the previous atrocities
inflicted upon them by the Bashi-Bazouks. The
Bulgarians were awarded a tremendous prize
of territory. If the grant had been confirmed
it would have made Bulgaria the paramount
power of the Balkan Peninsula. By the Treaty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
of San Stefano, Bulgaria was made an autonomous
principality subject to Turkey, with a Christian
government and national militia. The Prince
of Bulgaria was to be freely chosen by the people
and accepted by the Sublime Porte, with the
consent of the Powers. As regards internal
government, it was agreed that an assembly of
notables, presided over by an Imperial Commissioner
and attended by a Turkish Commissioner,
should meet at Philippopolis or Tirnova
before the election of the Prince to draw up a
constitutional statute similar to those of the
other Danubian principalities after the Treaty
of Adrianople in 1830. The boundaries of
Bulgaria were to include all that is now Bulgaria,
and the greater part of Thrace and Macedonia.</p>

<p>The European Congress of Berlin which revised
the Treaty of San Stefano recognised that the
motive of Russia was to create in Bulgaria a
vast but weak state, which would obediently
serve her interests and in time fall into her hands:
and that the injury proposed to be done to
Roumania was inspired by a desire to limit the
progress of a courageous but an unfortunately
independent-minded friend. The Congress was
suspicious of the Bulgarian arrangement, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
clipped off much of the territory assigned to the
new principality. The injury done to Roumania
was allowed to stand. Then, as in 1912-1913,
when Balkan boundaries were again under the
discussion of an inter-European Conference, the
vital interests of the great Powers surrounding
the Balkan Peninsula were to keep its peoples
divided and weak. Both Russia and Austria
had more or less defined territorial ambitions in
the Balkans: and it suited neither Power to see
any one Balkan state rise to such a standard
of greatness as would enable it to take the lead in
a Balkan Union. Especially was it not the wish
of Austria that any Balkan state should grow
to be so strong as to kill definitely the hope she
cherished of extending down the Adriatic and
towards the Aegean.</p>

<p>By the Treaty of Berlin, which followed the
Congress of Berlin, the greater part of the Balkan
Peninsula was freed altogether from Turkish
rule. Roumania and Serbia were relieved from
all suggestion of tribute or vassalage. Bulgaria
was left subject to a tribute (which was very
quickly afterwards repudiated). Where the
Turkish power was left in existence in European
Turkey it was a threatened existence, for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
newly freed Christian peoples began at once to
conspire to help to freedom their nationals left
still under Turkish rule. The war of 1912 began
to be prepared in 1878.</p>

<p>There was, however, a period of comparative
peace. Roumania, though discontented, decided
to bide her time. Her prince was crowned king
with a crown made from the metal of Turkish
cannon taken at Plevna. That was the only hint
that she gave of keeping in mind the greatness of
her services which had been so poorly rewarded.</p>

<p class="p2b">Montenegro, whilst deprived of the great and
the well-deserved expansion which the Treaty of
San Stefano offered, had some benefit from the
Treaty of Berlin. The area of the kingdom was
doubled and it won access to the Adriatic. A
little later the harbour of Dulcigno was ceded to
Montenegro by Turkey under pressure from the
Powers, and she was left with only one notable
grievance, that of being shut off from Serbia by
the Sanjak of Novi-Bazar, which Austria secured
for Turkey, apparently with the idea of one day
seizing it on her way down to <a id="Salonica"></a>Salonica.</p>

<p class="centerb">KING FERDINAND OF BULGARIA</p>
</div>

<p class="p2">Serbia increased her territory by one-fourth
under the Treaty of Berlin, but was not allowed
to extend towards the Adriatic, and, nurturing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
as she did a dream of reviving the old Serbian
Empire, was but poorly satisfied.</p>

<p>Bulgaria, if it had not been for the promises
of the Treaty of San Stefano, might have been
fairly content with the provisions of the Treaty
of Berlin. She had been the first nation in the
Balkans to yield to the Turks. She had allowed
her sons to act as mercenary soldiers to aid the
Turks against other Christians: and during the
period of oppression she had suffered less than
any from the rigours of the invader, had protested
less than any by force of arms. Yet now she
was given freedom as a gift won largely by the
sacrifices of others. But, though having the
most reason to be content, Bulgaria was the
least contented of all the Balkan States. The
restless ambition of the people guiding her
destinies was manifested in an internal revolution
which displaced the first prince (Alexander of
Battenberg) and put on the throne the present
king (Ferdinand of Coburg). Bulgaria, too,
repudiated the friendly tutelage which Russia
wished to exercise over her destinies.</p>

<p class="p2b">The territorial settlement made by the Berlin
Treaty was first broken by Bulgaria. That
treaty had cut the ethnological Bulgaria into two,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
leaving the southern half as a separate province
under the name of Eastern Rumelia. In 1885
Eastern Rumelia was annexed to Bulgaria with
the glad consent of its inhabitants, but in spite
of the wishes of Russia. Serbia saw in this the
threat of a Bulgarian hegemony in the Balkans,
and demanded some territorial compensation for
herself. This was refused. War followed. The
Bulgarians were victorious at the Battle of
Slivnitza, an achievement which was in great
measure due to the organising ability of Prince
Alexander. The victory secured Rumelia for
Bulgaria. But no sense of gratitude to Prince
Alexander survived, and the Russian intrigue
which secured his abdication and flight was
undoubtedly aided by a large section of the
Bulgarian people. Stambouloff, a peasant leader
of the Bulgarians and its greatest personality
since the War of Liberation, was faithful to
Alexander, but was not able to <a id="save_him"></a>save him.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

</p>

<p class="centerb">KING FERDINAND&#39;S BODYGUARD</p>
</div>

<p class="p2">The Bulgarian throne after Alexander's abdication
was offered to the King of Roumania. The
acceptance of the offer would possibly have led
to a real Balkan Federation. The united power
of Roumania and Bulgaria, exercised wisely,
could have gently pressed the other Balkan
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
peoples into a union. That, however, would
have suited the aims neither of Russia nor of
Austria, the two Empires which guided the
destinies of the Balkans, chiefly in the light of
their own selfish ends. The Roumanian king
refused the throne of Bulgaria, and in 1887
Prince Ferdinand of Coburg became Prince of
the State. It was not long before he fell out
with Stambouloff, the able but personally unamenable
patriot who chiefly had made modern
Bulgaria. In the conflict between the two Prince
Ferdinand proved the stronger. Stambouloff
was dismissed from office, and in 1895 was assassinated
in the streets of Sofia. No attempt was
made to punish his murderers.</p>

<p>In 1908 Bulgaria shook off the last shred of
dependence to Turkey. The bold action was the
crown of a clever diplomatic intrigue by Prince
Ferdinand. Since the murder of Stambouloff
the Prince had been sedulously cultivating in
public the friendship of Russia: but that had
not prevented him carrying to a great pitch of
mutual confidence a secret understanding with
Austria. The Austrian Empire was anxious to
annex formally the districts of Bosnia and
Herzegovina, of which it had long been in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
occupation. Objection to this would surely have
come from Russia; but Russia was impotent for
the time being after the disastrous war with
Japan. Just as surely it would come from Serbia
which would see thus definitely pass over to the
one Power, which she had reason to fear, a section
of Slav-inhabited country clearly connected to
the Serbs by racial ties. Serbia, it might be
expected, would have the support of France and
England as well as Russia. For Bulgaria the
offer to neutralise Serbia made to Austria all the
difference between an action which was a little
risky and an action which had no risk at all.
Bulgaria supported Austria in the annexation,
and, as was to have been expected, Serbia found
protest impossible, since Russia, France, and
England swallowed the affront to treaty obligations
to which they were parties. It was
Bulgaria's reward to have the support of the
Triple Alliance in throwing off all fealty and
tribute to the Sublime Porte. Prince Ferdinand
became the Czar Ferdinand of Bulgaria.</p>

<p>Nor was that the end of Bulgarian ambition.
The "big" Bulgaria of the San Stefano treaty
floated before the eyes of her rulers constantly,
and she began to prepare for a war against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
Turkey, of which the prize should be Thrace and
Macedonia. An obstacle in Macedonia was not
only that the Turks were in occupation, but
that the Greeks considered themselves entitled
to the reversion of the estate. Rivalry between
the three nations was responsible for the
Macedonian horrors, which went on from year to
year, and made one district of the Balkans a
veritable hell on earth. These horrors have been
set at the door of the "Unspeakable Turk."
The Turk has quite enough to answer for in the
many hideous crimes which he has undoubtedly
committed. It is not quite just to hold him
wholly responsible for the terrible state of
Macedonia during the last few years. Greek
and Bulgarian were alike interested in making
it appear to the world that Turkish rule in
Macedonia was impossible. To effect this they
insisted that rapine and massacre should become
normal. If the Turk did not wish for massacres
he was stirred up to massacres. Christian pastors
were not prevented by their Christian faith from
murders of their own people, if it could be certain
that the Turks would have the discredit of them.
Side by side with the atrocities which were committed
by Turks against Christians and Christians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
against Turks, the two sets of warring Christians,
the Bulgarian Exarchates and the Greek Patriarchates,
attacked one another with a fiendish relentlessness,
which equalled the most able efforts of the
Turks in the way of rape, murder, and robbery.</p>

<p>In excuse for part of this, <i>i.e.</i> that part which
stirred up the Turks to atrocities even when they
wished to be peaceful, there could be pleaded the
good object of striving for the end of all Turkish
rule in Christian districts of the Balkans. The
excuse will serve this far: that without a doubt
a Christian community cannot be governed justly
by the Turk, and the very strongest of steps are
warranted to put an end to Turkish domination
of a district largely inhabited by Christians.
But no consideration, even that of exterminating
Turkish rule, could justify all the Christian
atrocities perpetrated in Macedonia: and there
is certainly no shadow of an excuse for the
atrocities with which Bulgarian sought to score
against Greek and Greek against Bulgarian. The
era of those atrocities has not yet closed. The
Turk has been driven from Macedonia, but
Greek and Bulgarian continue their feud. For
the time the Greek is in the ascendant, whilst
the Bulgarian broods over a revenge.</p>

<h4>THE WARS OF 1912-13</h4>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">By</span> 1912, Greece, Bulgaria, Serbia, and Montenegro
had contrived, in spite of any past quarrels, in
spite of the mutual jealousies even then being
displayed in the recurring Macedonian massacres,
of Christians by Christians as well as by Turks,
to arrive at a sufficient degree of unity to allow
them to make war jointly on Turkey. Bulgaria
and Serbia concluded an offensive and defensive
alliance, arranging for all contingencies and
providing for the division of the spoils which it
was hoped to win from the Turks. Between
Bulgaria and Greece there was no such definite
alliance, but a military convention only. The
division of the spoil after the war was left to
future determination, both Greek and Bulgarian
probably having it clearly in his head that
he would have all his own way after the war or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
fight the issue out subsequently. A later Punch
cartoon put this peculiarity of a Balkan alliance
with pretty satire. Greece and Serbia were
discussing what they should do with the spoils
they were then winning from Bulgaria. "Of
course we shall fight for them. Are we not
allies?" said one of the partners.</p>

<p>I was through the war of 1912 as war correspondent
for the London <i>Morning Post</i>, and
followed the fortunes of the main Bulgarian
army in the Thracian campaign. In this book
I do not intend to attempt a history of the war
but will give some impressions of it which, whilst
not neglecting any of the chief facts in any
part of the theatre of operations, will naturally be
mainly based on observations with the Bulgarians.</p>

<p>First, with regard to the political side of the
war, one could not but be struck by the exceedingly
careful preparation that the Bulgarians had made
for the struggle. It was no unexpected or sudden
war. They had known for some time that war
was inevitable, having made up their minds for
a considerable time that the wrongs of their
fellow-nationals in Macedonia and Thrace would
have to be righted by force of arms. Attempts
on the part of the Powers to enforce reforms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
in the Christian Provinces of Turkey had, in the
opinion of the Bulgars, been absolute failures,
and they had done their best to make them
failures, wishing for a destroyed Turkey not a
reformed Turkey. In their opinion there was
nothing to hope for except armed intervention
on their part against Turkey. And, believing
that, they had made most careful preparation
extending over several years for the struggle.
That preparation was in every sense admirable.
For instance, it had extended, so far as I could
gather, from informants in Bulgaria, to this
degree: that they formed military camps in
winter for the training of their troops. Thus
they did not train solely in the most favourable
time of the year for man&#339;uvres, but in the
unfavourable weather too, in case that time
should prove the best for their war. The excellence
of their artillery arm, and the proof
of the scientific training of their officers, prove
to what extent their training beforehand had
gone.</p>

<p>When war became inevitable, the Balkan
League having been formed, and the time being
ripe for the war, Bulgaria in particular, and the
Balkan States in general, were quite determined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
that war should be. The Turks at this time
were inclined to make reforms and concessions;
they had an inclination to ease the pressure on
their Christian subjects in the Christian provinces.
Perhaps knowing&mdash;perhaps not knowing&mdash;that
they were unready for war themselves, but
feeling that the Balkan States were preparing
for war, the Turks were undoubtedly willing to
make great concessions. But whatever concessions
the Turks might have offered, war would
still have taken place. I do not think one need
offer any harsh criticism about the Balkan nations
for coming to that decision. If you have made
your preparation for war&mdash;perhaps a very expensive
preparation, perhaps a preparation which
has involved very great commitments apart from
expense&mdash;it is not reasonable to suppose that at
the last moment you will consent to desist from
making that war. The line which you may have
been prepared to take before you made your
preparations you may not be prepared to take
after the preparations have been made. And,
as the Turks found out afterwards, the terms
which were offered to them before the outbreak
of the war were not the same terms as would
be listened to after that event.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
To a pro-Turk it all will seem a little
unscrupulous. But it is after the true fashion
of diplomacy or warlike enterprise. The simple
position was that Turkey was obviously a decadent
Power; that her territories were envied and that
if there had not been a real grievance (there was
a real grievance) one would have been manufactured
to justify a war of spoliation. It not
being necessary to manufacture a grievance, the
existing one was carefully nursed and stimulated:
and when the ripe time came for war the unreal
pretext that war was the alternative to reform
and could be avoided by reform was put forward.
No reform would have stopped the war just as
no "reform" would stop, say, San Marino
attacking the British Empire if she wanted something
which the British Empire has got and felt
that she could get it by an attack.</p>

<p>I do not think that the Balkan League would
have withdrawn from the war supposing the
Turks before the outbreak of the war had offered
autonomy of the Christian provinces. I was
informed in very high quarters, and I believe
profoundly, that if the Turks had offered so much
at that time the war would still have taken
place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
There is another interesting lesson to be
gleaned from the political side of this war.
At the outset, the Powers, when endeavouring
to prevent hostilities, made an announcement
that, whatever the result of the war, no territorial
benefit would be allowed to any of the
participants; that is to say, the Balkan States
were informed, on the authority of all Europe,
that if they did go to war, and if they won
victories they would be allowed no fruits from
those victories. The Balkan States recognised,
as I think all sensible people must recognise,
that a victorious army makes its own laws.
They treated this <i>caveat</i> which was issued by
the Powers of Europe as a matter to be politely
set aside; and ignored it.</p>

<p>Political experience seems to show that if a
nation, under any circumstances, wishes its
international rights to be respected, it must be
ready to fight for them. There is proof from
contemporary history in the respective fates of
Switzerland and Korea. Both nations once stood
in very much the same position internationally;
that their independence was, in a sense, guaranteed.
Korea's independence was guaranteed by both
the United States and Great Britain. But the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
independence of Korea has now vanished. Korea
could not fight for herself, and nobody was going
to fight for a nation which could not fight for
herself. The independence of Switzerland is
maintained because Switzerland would be a very
thorny problem for any Power in search of territory
to tackle. In case of an attack on Switzerland,
that country would be able to help herself and
her friends.</p>

<p>On the opposite side of the argument, we see
the Balkan League entering upon a desperate
war, warned that they would be allowed no
territorial advantage from that war, but engaging
upon it because they recognised that a victorious
army makes its own laws.</p>

<p class="p2b">It was of wonderful value to the Bulgarian
generals entering upon this war that the whole
Bulgarian nation was filled with the martial
spirit&mdash;was, in a sense, wrapped up in the colours.
Every male Bulgarian citizen was trained to
the use of arms. Every Bulgarian citizen of
fighting age was engaged either at the front or
on the lines of communication. Before the war,
every Bulgarian man, being a soldier, was under
a soldier's honour; and the preliminaries of the
war, the preparations for mobilisation in particular,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
were carried out with a degree of secrecy that,
I think, astonished every Court and every
Military Department in Europe. The secret
was so well kept that one of the diplomatists
in Roumania left for a holiday three days before
the declaration of war, feeling certain that there
was to be no war. Bulgaria is not governed
altogether autocratically, but is a very free
democracy in some respects. It has a newspaper
Press that, on ordinary matters, for delightful
irresponsibility, might be matched in London.
Yet not a single whisper of what the nation was
designing and planning leaked abroad. Because
the whole nation was a soldier, and the whole
nation was under a soldier's honour, secrecy
could be kept. No one abroad knew anything,
either from the babbling of "Pro-Turks," or
from the newspapers, that a great campaign
was being <a id="designed"></a>designed.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<p class="ralign"><span class="caption">
<i>Topical Press</i></span></p>

<p class="centerb">BULGARIAN TROOPS LEAVING SOFIA</p>
</div>

<p class="p2">The Secret Service of Bulgaria before the war
evidently had been excellent. They seemed to
know all that was necessary to know about the
country in which they were going to fight. This
very complete knowledge of theirs was in part
responsible for the arrangements which were made
between the Balkan Allies for carrying on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
war. The Bulgarian people had made up their
minds to do the lion's share of the work, and to
have the lion's share of the spoils. They knew
quite definitely the state of corruption to which
the Turkish nation had come. When I reached
Sofia, the Bulgarians told me they were going
to be in Constantinople three weeks after the
declaration of war. That was the view that
they took of the possibilities of the campaign.
And they kept their programme as far as Chatalja
fairly closely.</p>

<p>The view of the Bulgarians as to the ultimate
result of the war, and what they had designed
should be the division of spoil after the war,
I gathered from various classes in Bulgaria,
speaking not only with politicians but with
bankers, trading people, and others. They concluded
that the Turk was going to be driven out
of Europe, at any rate, as far as Constantinople.
They considered that Constantinople was too
great a prize for the Bulgarian nation, or for the
Balkan States, and that Constantinople would
be left as an international city, to be governed
by a commission of the Great Powers. Bulgaria
was, then, to have practically all Turkey-in-Europe&mdash;the
province of Thrace, and a large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
part of Macedonia as far as the city of Salonica.
Constantinople was to be left, with a small
territory, as an international city, and the
Bulgarian boundary was to stretch as far as
Salonica. Salonica, they admitted, was desired
very much by the Bulgarians, and also very
much by the Greeks; and the Bulgarian idea
in regard to Salonica before the war was that it
would be best to make it a free Balkan city,
governed by all the Balkan States in common,
and a free port for all the Balkan States. Then
the frontier of Greece was to extend very much
to the north, and Greece was to be allowed all
the Aegean Islands. The Serbian frontier was
to extend to the eastward and the southward,
and what is now the autonomous province of
Albania (the creation of which has been insisted
on by the Powers) was to be divided between
Montenegro and Servia.</p>

<p>That division would have left the Bulgarians
with the greatest spoil of the war. They would
have had entry on to the Sea of Marmora; they
would have controlled, perhaps, one side of
the Dardanelles (but I believe they thought
that the Dardanelles might also be left to a
commission of the Powers). It needed great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
confidence and exact knowledge as to the state
of the Turkish Army to allow plans of that sort
to have been not only formed, but to be generally
talked about.</p>

<p>It must be tragical now for a patriotic Bulgarian
to compare these high anticipations with the
actual results of the war, and to reflect that at
one time he had three-fourths of his hopes secure
and then sacrificed all by straining after the
remainder.</p>

<p>The Bulgarian mobilisation&mdash;effected after
lengthy preparation with perfect success and
complete secrecy&mdash;was a triumph of military
achievement. It emphasises a point often urged,
that when a whole nation is wrapt up in the
colours, when every citizen is a soldier and taught
the code of patriotic honour of the soldier&mdash;then
at a time of crisis, spies, grumblers, critics are
impossible. Bulgaria, as I have said, is very
democratic. Unlike Roumania, where a landed
aristocracy survived Turkish rule, the whole
nation is of peasants or the sons and grandsons
of peasants. The nobles, the wealthy, the intellectuals
were exterminated by the Turk. Yet
the strategy of the war suffered nothing from
the democracy of the people. They acted with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
a unity, a secrecy, and a loyalty to the flag that
no despotism could rival.</p>

<p>The mobilisation was effected on very slender
resources. Official statistics&mdash;perhaps for a
reason&mdash;are silent regarding the growth of railway
material since 1909. But in that year there
were only 155 locomotives in the country. As
soon as war was anticipated these provident
and determined people set to amassing railway
material, and one railway official, without giving
exact figures, talked of locomotives being added
by "fifties" at a time. I doubt that. But
perhaps there were between 200 and 225 locomotives
in Bulgaria in October 1912, though one
military attaché gave me the figure at 193. It
was a slender stock, in any case, on which to
move 350,000 men and to keep them in supplies.
But the people contributed all their horses,
mules, and oxen to the war fund. Soldiers
were willing and able to walk great distances,
and within a few days all the armies were over
the frontier.</p>

<p>The Bulgarians, by the way, began the war
with a <i>moratorium</i>. (The week of the declaration
of hostilities, meeting some personages notable
in European finance, they ridiculed for this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
reason the idea of the war being anything but
a dismal failure from the point of view of the
Balkan States.) It was necessary to win in a
hurry if they were to win at all. They could
take the field only because of the magnificent
spirit of their population. They could not keep
the field indefinitely under any circumstances.</p>

<p>The main line of communication was through
Yamboli, and here the chief force was massed
whilst exploratory work was carried on towards
Adrianople and Kirk Kilisse. I believe that
originally the capture of Adrianople was the
first grand object of the campaign, and that a
modification was made later either for political
or military reasons, or for a mixture of both.
Up to the point at which Adrianople was invested
from the north, Kirk Kilisse captured, and the
cavalry sent raiding south-west to attack the
Turk's lines of communication and to feel for
his field army, an excellent plan of campaign
was followed. If the main Bulgarian army had
then swung over from Kirk Kilisse and had
made a resolute&mdash;and, under the circumstances,
almost certainly victorious&mdash;effort to rush
Adrianople the natural course, from a military
point of view, would have been followed. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
one risk involved was that the Turkish field army
would come up from the south and force a battle
under the walls of Adrianople, aided by a sortie
from the garrison. But the experience of Kirk
Kilisse and the following battles argued against
this. There would have been, one may judge,
ample time allowed to subdue Adrianople with
an army flushed by its success at Kirk Kilisse,
operating against a garrison thoroughly despondent
at the moment.</p>

<p>Kirk Kilisse, it must be noted in passing,
was a vastly overrated fortress. The Turks,
I believe, valued it highly. The Bulgarians
triumphantly quoted a German opinion that it
could withstand a German army for three months.
As a matter of fact, whilst it was a valuable
base for an enterprising field army, surrounded
as it was by natural features of great strength,
it was not a real fortress at all. Still, the moral
effect of its capture was great, and on the flood
of that success the Bulgarian army could have
entered Adrianople if it had been willing to make
the necessary great sacrifice of infantry.</p>

<p>A second sound&mdash;and more enterprising, and
therefore probably better course&mdash;was that which
I thought at the time was being followed, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
pursue the Turks fleeing from Kirk Kilisse, to
search out their field army, give it a thrashing,
and then swing back to subdue Adrianople. But
neither of these courses was followed. Kirk
Kilisse was not followed up vigorously in the
first instance. After its capture the Bulgarian
army rested three days. During that time the
fleeing Turks had won back some of their courage,
had come back in their tracks, recovered many
of the guns they had abandoned, and the battles
of Ivankeui and Yanina&mdash;battles in which the
Bulgarian losses were very heavy&mdash;were necessary
to do over again work which had been already
once accomplished. This criticism must be read
in the light of the fact that I am totally ignorant
of the transport position in the Bulgarian Third
Army at the time. General Demetrieff had made
a wonderful dash over the wild country between
Yamboli and Kirk Kilisse, carrying an army
over a track which took a military attaché six
days to traverse on horseback, and a hospital
train seven days to traverse by ox wagon. He
might at the time have been seriously short
of ammunition, though Kirk Kilisse renewed
his food and forage supplies.</p>

<p>After three days the Bulgarians moved on.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
Ivankeui and Yanina were won, and the pursuit
continued until Lule Burgas, where the Turkish
army in the field was decisively defeated and
driven with great slaughter towards Chorlu,
where its second stand was expected. That
expectation was not realised. The flight continued
to Chatalja. This was the turning-point
of the campaign. Up to now the Bulgarian
success had been complete. If now Adrianople
had been made the main objective, with a small
"holding" force left at Chorlu, the entry into
Constantinople would possibly have been realised.
But the decision was made to "mask" Adrianople
and to push on with all available force towards
Constantinople.</p>

<p>In considering this decision it is easy to be
misled by giving Adrianople merely the value of
a fortress in the rear, holding a garrison capable
of some offensive, necessitating the detachment
of a large holding force. But that was not the
position. Actually Adrianople straddled the only
practical line of communication for effective
operations against the enemy's capital. The
railway from Bulgaria to Constantinople passed
through Adrianople. Excepting that line of
railway, there was no other railroad, and there
was no other carriage road, one might say, for
the Turk did not build roads. Once across the
Turkish frontier there were tracks, not roads.</p>
<p class="p2b"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 336px;">

<span class="caption">GENERAL DEMETRIEFF, THE CONQUEROR AT LULE BURGAS</span>
</div>

<p class="p2">The effect of leaving Adrianople in the hands
of the enemy was that supplies for the army in
the field coming from Bulgaria could travel by
one of two routes. They could come through
Yamboli to Kirk Kilisse, or they could come
through Novi Zagora to Mustapha Pasha by
railway, and then to Kirk Kilisse around
Adrianople. From Kirk Kilisse to the rail-head
at Seleniki, close to Chatalja, they could
come not by railway, but by a tramway, a very
limited railway. If Adrianople had fallen, the
railway would have been open. The Bulgarian
railway services had, I think, something over
100 powerful locomotives at the outset of the
war, and whilst it was a single line in places,
it was an effective line right down to as near
Constantinople as they could get.</p>

<p>But, Adrianople being in the hands of the
enemy, supplies coming from Yamboli had to
travel to Kirk Kilisse by track, mostly by bullock
wagon, and that journey took five, six, or seven
days. The British Army Medical Detachment,
travelling over that road, took seven days. If
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
one took the other road you got to Mustapha
Pasha comfortably by railway. And then it
was necessary to use bullock or horse transport
from Mustapha Pasha to Kirk Kilisse. That
journey I took twice; once with an ox wagon,
and afterwards with a set of fast horses, and the
least period for that journey was five days.
From Kirk Kilisse there was a line of light railway
joining the main line. But on that line the
Bulgarians had only six engines, and, I think,
thirty-two carriages; so that, for practical purposes,
the railway was of very little use indeed
past Mustapha Pasha. Whilst Adrianople was
in the hands of the enemy, the Bulgarians had
practically no line of communication.</p>

<p>My reason for believing that it was not the
original plan of the generals to leave Adrianople
"masked" is, that in the first instance I have
a high opinion of the generals, and I do not think
they could have designed that; but think rather
it was forced upon them by the politicians saying,
"We must hurry through, we must attempt
something, no matter how desperate it is, something
decisive." In the second instance, after
Adrianople had been attacked in a very half-hearted
way, and after the main Bulgarian army<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
had pushed on to the lines of Chatalja, the
Bulgarians called in the aid of a Serbian division
to help them against Adrianople. I am sure they
would not have done that if it had not been their
wish to subdue Adrianople. To be forced to invoke
Serbian aid was a serious wound to their vanity.</p>

<p>The position of the Bulgarian army on the
lines of Chatalja, with Adrianople in the hands
of the enemy, was this: that it took practically
their whole transport facilities to keep the army
supplied with food, and there was no possibility
of keeping the army properly supplied with
ammunition. So if the Bulgarian generals had
really designed to carry the lines of Chatalja
without first attacking Adrianople, they miscalculated
seriously. But I do not think they
did; I think it was a plan forced upon them
by political authority, feeling that the war must
be pushed to a conclusion somehow. Why the
Bulgarians did not take Adrianople quickly in
the first place is to be explained simply by the
fact that they could not. But if their train of
sappers had been of the same kind of stuff as
their field artillery, they could have taken
Adrianople in the first week of the war. The
Bulgarians, however, had no effective siege train.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
A Press photographer at Mustapha Pasha was
very much annoyed because photographs he
had taken of guns passing through the town
were not allowed to be sent through to his paper.
He sent a humorous message to his editor, that
he could not send photographs of guns, "it being
a military secret that the Bulgarians had any
guns." But the reason the Bulgarians did not
want photographs taken was that these guns were
practically useless for the purpose for which they
were intended.</p>

<p>In short, whilst Adrianople stood it was
impossible to keep 250,000 men in the field at
Chatalja with the guns and ammunition necessary
for their work. Therefore the taking of
Adrianople should have followed the Battle of
Lule Burgas.</p>

<p>A reservation is perhaps necessary. If after
Lule Burgas the victorious Bulgarians had been
able to push on at once, the fleeing Turks might
have been followed to the very walls of Constantinople.
If even the flower of the force to the
extent of 50,000 men had gone on with all the
guns, ammunition, and food possible, the enterprise
would probably have succeeded. But one
may judge that that too was impossible, in view<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
of the transport position. There was a long
pause. Then an attempt was made to do
deliberately against an entrenched army what it
was thought impossible to do against a fleeing
rabble. Reasons of humanity were given to me
to explain the hesitation to assault Adrianople.
The Bulgarians shrank from the great expenditure
of men necessary, from the sacrifice of the Christian
population involved. Such reasons would be
admirable if truthful; but they are not war.</p>

<p>When the action against the lines of Chatalja
was at last opened the Turks had had time to
entrench strongly, to recover their wind, to
recognise that they had come to the last ditch.
On November 17, after the artillery reconnaissance
of the position by the Bulgarians, I
had slight hope that success would be possible;
it looked as if they were short of ammunition,
and not well supplied with food. Shells were
used very sparingly. When a storm was necessary
there was a shower. Even on that day infantrymen
were asked to do the work of shrapnel, and
valuable lives paid for very slight information.
Still, the Turkish artillery work was so poor;
their sticking to their trenches was so persistent,
that I half anticipated that the night would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
see a big Bulgarian success on the left flank,
making an effective attack on the centre possible
with the morning. But by next morning little
had been done. That day was spent in a heroic
display of infantry courage. Men rushed out
from trenches against forts the strength of which
was unknown, with practically no artillery backing.
Certainly the day was misty, and artillery
work could not have been properly effective. If
the position was&mdash;as I guess it was&mdash;that there
was no adequate supply of ammunition, the
choice of the day was good. If it were possible
to succeed with infantry alone it would have been
possible on that day and with those men. But
it was impossible. That night operations were
suspended, and negotiations for peace followed.</p>

<p>Meanwhile in other quarters of the theatre
of war the Balkan Allies had been doing as well
or even better. True, the Montenegrins were
not very successful against Scutari (it did not
fall until the second phase of the war), and the
Greeks had been held up at Janina. But the
Serbians had swept the Turks from Old Serbia
and from Northern Macedonia in fine style, and
had carried through an expedition of great
gallantry over the mountains to the Adriatic.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
As the Bulgarians and Turks stood at bay on
opposite ranges of hills within 25 miles of Constantinople,
all that was left of Turkish territory
in Europe was the little peninsula on which
Constantinople stood, the peninsula of Gallipoli,
and the towns of Adrianople, Scutari, and
Janina. It was certainly high time for the Turk
to talk of peace.</p>

<p>War was now interrupted for a time to allow
the Balkan Allies who had shown themselves
so gallant in war to show their mettle as statesmen
and negotiators. It is one of the established
facts of history that warlike prowess alone has
never made a nation securely great. Within the
Balkan Peninsula that was made plain during
the invasions of the Goths and the Huns. There
was now to be a melancholy modern proof. At
the end of 1912 the Balkan States, united and
victorious, were in the position to take the Balkan
Peninsula for themselves and keep out European
interference for the future. They had soon
dissipated all this advantage with mutual jealousies
and blundering negotiations. Already, before the
Peace Conference had actually begun its work,
charges and counter-charges of atrocities were
bandied about between Bulgar and Greek. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
Greek official account set forth the following
accusations:</p>

<blockquote><p>The detailed inquiry with regard to excesses and
crimes committed by the Bulgarian army shows that
they constitute a cause for the disturbances reported
during the first days after the surrender of Salonica.
According to this inquiry, the excesses of the Bulgarians
can be divided into three categories: (1) damage to
property; (2) crimes against the life and honour of
private persons, especially Turks; and (3) offences&mdash;and
these were the less frequent&mdash;due to misconceived
political interest. In the majority of cases Bulgarian
soldiers and peasants gave themselves up to pillaging.
At Vassilika, Agiaparaskevi, Apostola, Alihatzilar, Serres,
Langada, Asvestohori, Baroritza, Tohanli, Karaburnu,
Vardar, Doiran, and Salonica pillaging and thefts of
all kinds were committed, the stolen articles including
horses, goats, sheep, barley, hay, jewels, and other
articles of value, large sums of money, carpets, furniture,
clothes, and arms. Attacks were made on Austrian
subjects, and the Austrian Consulate in consequence,
lodged an energetic protest. Unspeakable outrages
were committed at Serres and at the other towns and
villages mentioned above. At Doiran, despite the
protests of the municipality, the Bulgarians seized and
imprisoned the rich Turkish residents, who after having
secured their liberty by the payment of enormous
ransoms, were ambushed by the Bulgarians and massacred,
sixty of them being killed.</p>

<p class="p2b">The political crimes were of little importance, as the
greater number of the Bulgarians ardently desire the
maintenance of the Balkan Alliance, especially a Greco-Bulgarian
<i>entente</i>, safeguarding their political <a id="interests"></a>interests.</p></blockquote>

On the Bulgarian side just as positive charges
against the Greeks were made. It is not my
province to attempt to judge as to the truth of
the Salonica events, but I quote this official
charge as illustrative of the spirit which had
come over the Balkan League before the close
of 1912.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h4>A CHAPTER IN BALKAN DIPLOMACY</h4>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Watching</span> through many exciting weeks the
course of a Balkan Peace Conference, I had the
opportunity of seeing another phase of the Near
Eastern character in its various sub-divisions&mdash;the
Turkish, the Grecian, the Roumanian, the
Bulgarian, and the Serbian. It was in certain
general characteristics the same character with
certain points of difference, ranging from almost
purely Oriental through various grades until it
reached to a phase which was rather more than
half European. In various aspects it was naïve,
wily, deceitful, vainglorious, truculent, servile,
stubborn, supple. At times it was very trying.
Usually it was distinctly amusing. There were
some exceptions among the Balkan statesmen,
but as a rule they were men of very ordinary
ability and very extraordinary conceit. Close<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
association with them dissipated for a time the
extremely good impression that Bulgarian,
Serbian, Grecian, and Roumanian peasants and
officials and traders had made on me, meeting
them as soldiers or as wayside hosts.</p>

<p>When the Bulgarian progress towards Constantinople
was stopped at Chatalja, the Bulgarian
authorities favoured negotiations for peace. To
this Greece very strenuously, and Serbia more
gently, objected. They offered as an alternative
suggestion to send aid to the Chatalja lines to
help Bulgaria to force things to a conclusion
there. But by this time the Balkan Allies were
at least as much suspicious of one another as
they were hostile to the Turk. The troubles
after the fall of Salonica had given a picturesque
illustration of the hollowness of the Balkan
League. Greece and Bulgaria had raced armies
down for the capture of that city, and the Greeks
had won in the race by bribing the Turkish
commander to surrender to them&mdash;the Bulgarians
said sourly (an absurd accusation!). Now
Bulgarian and Greek were at the point of open
war in Salonica, and were doing a little odd
killing of one another to keep their hands in
practice. Around Adrianople Bulgarian and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
Serbian were growling at one another, the
Bulgarians treating their friends rather badly,
so far as I could judge. Both racial sections of
the army of siege were inclined to do very little,
because each was waiting for the other to begin.
Bulgaria, too, was extremely anxious to have no
more friendly allied troops in the areas which
she had marked out for herself. She was aware
that the Greek population of Thrace was agitating
for an autonomous Thrace instead of a Bulgarian
annexation, and feared that the presence of a
Greek army in the province would strengthen
this movement.</p>

<p>In the upshot Serbia and Montenegro supported
Bulgaria in the signing of an armistice. Greece
refused to sign an armistice, but joined in the
negotiations for a final peace which opened
at the Conference of St. James's, London, in
December 1912. This Conference quickly resolved
itself into a wonderful acrobatic display
of ground and lofty fiction, of strange childish
"bluffs," of complicated efforts at mystery
which would not deceive a Punch-and-Judy show
audience.</p>

<p>In the East and the Near East, the man who
wants to buy a horse goes to the market-place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
in the first instance, and curses publicly all
horses and thoughts of horses. He proclaims
that he will see his father's tomb defiled before he
will ever touch a horse again. Hearing of this,
a man who wishes to sell a horse appears in public,
and proclaims that the horse he has in his stall
is the sun and the moon and the stars of his life:
that sooner than part with it he would eat filth
and become as a dog. At this stage the negotiations
for a bargain are in fair progress. After
some days&mdash;the East and the Near East is not very
thrifty with time&mdash;a satisfactory bargain is struck.</p>

<p>The Balkan Peace Conference was carried
on very much on those lines. In a London
winter atmosphere, among the unimaginative
and matter-of-fact London population, the effect
was strangely fantastic. In an early stage of
the negotiations the Turkish delegates (who were
out to gain time in the desperate hope that something
would turn up) said one day that they must
ask for instructions on some point, about which
they were as fully instructed as it was possible
to be: said the next sitting day that unfortunately
their instructions had not arrived:
and the next sitting day that their instructions
had arrived but unfortunately they could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
decipher some of the words, and must refer to
Constantinople again! With all this it was
difficult to believe that we lived in a civilised age
of telegraphs and newspapers and railway trains.
The mind was transported back insensibly to the
times of the great Caliph of Bagdad.</p>

<p>Whilst the Turks dallied in the hope that something
would turn up, and devoted a painstaking
but painfully obvious industry to the task of
trying to sow dissensions among the Balkan
Allies, these Balkan Allies engaged among themselves
in a vigorous Press campaign of mutual
abuse and insinuation. The seeds of dissension
which the Turk was scattering refused to
germinate, because already the field which was
sown had a full-grown crop. But the Balkan
Allies had one point of elementary common
sense. They were resolved to take from the Turk
all that was possible before they fell out among
themselves as to the division of the spoil. (As
it happened, they forgot to take into account
the contingency that after the division it would
still be within the power of the Turk to seek
some revenge if they abandoned their League
of Alliance, which alone had made the humiliation
of the Turkish Empire possible.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
The first squabble between the Allies was
over the appointment of a leader or chief spokesman
of the Balkan delegates. If there had been
a touch of imagination and real friendliness
between them they would have selected the
senior Montenegrin delegate in acknowledgment
of the gallantry which had kept Montenegro
during all the centuries unsubdued by the Turkish
invader. Or there were reasons why the chief
Greek delegate should have been chosen, as he
was Prime Minister in his own country, and
therefore the senior delegate in official position.
But there was not enough good feeling among
the Allies to allow of any such settlement. The
delegation was left without an official spokesman
and there had to be a roster of Presidents in
alphabetical order as the only way to soothe the
embittered jealousies of rival allies. That was
the first of a series of childish incidents.</p>

<p>Some of the delegates talked with the utmost
freedom to the Press: and if what they told was
not always accurate it was nearly always interesting.
The loathsome wiles of the other Balkan
fellow and his black treachery were explained
at length. It seemed seriously to be thought
that British and European opinion would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
influenced by this sort of fulmination in the
more irresponsible Press.</p>

<p>Diplomacy under these conditions was bound
to fail. The Turkish position was at the time
plainly desperate if only military considerations
were taken into account. A united front on the
part of the Balkan delegates, combining firmness
with some suavity, would have convinced even
the procrastinating Turkish mind that the game
was up and the only thing to do was to make
a peace on lines of "cutting the loss." But the
constant quarrels of the Balkan States' representatives
between themselves encouraged the Turks
day by day to think that a definite split must
come between the Allies, and with a split the
chance for Turkey to find a way out of her
desperate position. As it happened, Turkey
played that game too long: and the war was
resumed and further heavy bloodshed caused.
Then the Peace Conference resumed with Turkey
and Bulgaria, apparently very anxious for peace
on terms dictated by the Powers: and Greece
and Serbia anxious now for delays because they
had made up their minds that it was necessary
to defend themselves against Bulgaria, and they
wished time for their preparations.</p>

<p class="centerb">ROUMANIAN SOLDIERS IN BUCHAREST</p>
</div>

<p class="p2">
Throughout both Conferences Roumania
hovered about in the offing waiting confidently
for an opportunity for pickings. Roumania had
learned well the lesson taught her by European
diplomacy after the War of Liberation. Then
she had done great work, made enormous sacrifices,
and won not rewards but robberies. In the
Balkan Wars of 1912-13 she stood apart, risking
nothing, and waiting for the exhaustion of the
combatants to put in her claims.</p>

<p>The second session of the Balkan Peace Conference
came to an abrupt end through practically
an ultimatum from the British Foreign Secretary,
Sir Edward Grey, that peace with Turkey on
the lines determined by the Powers must be
signed at once. The Grecian and Serbian
delegates saw then that the game of delay
could no longer be played, signed the Peace of
London, and hurried away to their homes expecting
an attack from Bulgaria.</p>

<p>Some strange infatuation drove the Bulgarian
leaders at that time to a fit of madness. They
had just wrung the last atom of concession from
Turkey, and had an enormous undisputed access
of territory in Thrace and in eastern Macedonia,
with a good coastal frontage on the Aegean.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
True, they were faced with a demand for a small
territorial concession by Roumania, and Greece
disputed the right of Bulgaria to an area of
northern Macedonia, and Serbia disputed with
her over her Macedonian area. It would have
been quite within the rules of Balkan diplomacy
for Bulgaria to have sought the help of one of
her neighbours, so that she might withstand
the others. With proper adroitness she might
have robbed each in turn with the help of the
others. But Bulgaria elected to fight all of them
at once. To Roumania she was rude, to Serbia
stiff, to Greece provocative. By joining hands
with Serbia, which had helped her very gallantly
at Adrianople, and was now much injured by the
decision of the Powers that she was not to keep
the Adriatic territory which she had won in the
war, Bulgaria might have coerced Greece and
Turkey at least, and perhaps have struck a
better bargain with Roumania. But she had
conciliation for none.</p>

<p>The events that followed are as tragical as
any that I can recall in history. Bulgaria had
within a few weeks raised herself to a position
which promised her headship of a Balkan Confederation.
She might have been the Prussia of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
a new Empire. Within a few days her blunders,
her intolerance, and her bad faith had humbled
her to the dust. As soon as she attacked Greece
and Serbia&mdash;to attack such a combination was
absurd&mdash;Roumania moved down upon her
northern frontier, and the Turk moved up from
the south. Neither Roumanian nor Turk were
opposed. The whole Bulgarian strength was
kept for her late Allies: and yet the Bulgarian
forces were decisively routed by both Serbians
and Greeks.</p>

<p>Of the dark incidents of that fratricidal war
no history will ever tell the truth. No war
correspondents nor military <i>attachés</i> accompanied
the forces. From the accusations and counter-accusations
of the combatants, from the eloquent
absence of prisoners, from the ghastly gaps in
the ranks of the armies when they returned from
the field, it is clear that the war was carried on
as a rule without mercy and without chivalry.
There was no very plentiful supply of ammunition
on either side. That fact enabled the combatants
to approach one another more closely and to
inflict more savage slaughter. During the course
of the war with Turkey the Balkan Allies lost
75,000 slain. During the war between themselves,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
though it lasted only a few days, it is said that
this number was exceeded.</p>

<p class="p2b">Roumania, whose army though invading
Bulgaria engaged in no battle, finally dictated
terms of peace. The Peace of Bucharest supplanted
the Peace of London. Bulgaria, beaten
to the ground, had to give up all that Roumania
demanded, and practically all that Greece and
Serbia demanded. It was a characteristic incident
of Balkan diplomacy that the unhappy
Bulgarians, having the idea of conciliating
Roumania, conveyed the territory to that state
with expressions of joy and gratitude, to which
expressions the wily Roumanians gave exactly
their true <a id="value"></a>value.</p>

<p class="p2">Turkey, meanwhile, had taken full advantage
of the opportunity given to her by Bulgaria.
Beaten decisively she had had to agree to give
up all her European possessions with the exception
of those beyond a line drawn from Enos on
the Black Sea to Midia on the Aegean. She
saw now Bulgaria powerless and calmly marched
back, and seized again practically all Thrace,
including Adrianople, over which had been fought
such great battles, and Kirk Kilisse. The
Bulgarians protested, appealed to Europe, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
Roumania in vain, then accepted the situation
and professed a warm friendship for Turkey.
There seemed to be a movement for a joint Turkish-Bulgarian
attack upon Greece, which would have
put the last touch upon this tragic comedy of
the Balkans. But the Powers vetoed this enterprise
if ever it were contemplated, and the
Balkans for a while, except for a little massacring
in Macedonia and Albania, enjoyed an unquiet
peace. But the forces of hate and revenge waited
latent.</p>

<p>The city which figured most prominently in
the Balkan Wars of 1912-13 and the intervening
diplomacy was Adrianople, the city founded by
the Emperor Adrian. It has seen more bloodshed
probably than any other city of the world.
It was before Adrianople that the Roman Emperor
Valerius and his army were destroyed by the
Goths, and the fate of the Roman Empire sealed
(a.d. 378). It was Adrianople that was first
captured by the Turkish invaders of the Balkans
to serve as their capital until they could at a later
date capture Constantinople. Many sieges and
battles it saw until 1912, when the Bulgarians
and Serbians gathered around its marshy plains,
and after several months of siege finally carried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
it by assault. Finally it was re-captured by a
mere cavalry patrol of the Turks.</p>

<p>Adrianople has its beauties seen from afar.
The great mosque with four slender minarets
shines out from the midst of gardens and picturesque
villas over the wide plain which marks the
confluence of the Maritza and the Tchundra
Rivers. But on nearer examination Adrianople,
like all other Turkish towns, is dirty, unkempt,
squalid. Most Turkish towns in the Balkans&mdash;Mustapha
Pasha on the Maritza was an exception,
looking dirty and unattractive from any point
of view&mdash;have a certain enchantment when they
first catch the eye of the traveller. It is the
custom of the richer Turks to build their villas
on the high ground around a town if there is
any, and to surround them with gardens. These
embowered houses and the slender fingers pointing
skyward of the minarets, give a first impression
of ample space, of delicacy in architecture.
Closer knowledge discloses the town as a herd of
hovels, irregularly set in a sea of mud (in dry
weather a dirty heap of dust), with the hilly
outskirts alone tolerable.</p>

<p>I regret the wild Balkan diplomacy which
doomed that Adrianople should go back to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
Turks. The Bulgarians would have made a fine
clean city of it: and had a project to canalise
the Maritza and bring to the old city of Adrian
all the advantages of a seaport. Possibly, that
will come in the near future if, in renewing their
strength, the Bulgarian nation learn also some
sense of diplomacy and moderation in using it.</p>

<p>Now the position is that for the first time for
very many years the old principle has been broken
that the Turkish tide may retreat but must
never advance in Europe. During the negotiations
of the first session of the Balkan Peace
Conference, the Balkan Committee&mdash;a London
organisation which exists to befriend the Balkan
States&mdash;urged:</p>

<blockquote><p>Any district which should be restored to Turkish rule would be not only
beyond the possibility of rehabilitation, but would suffer the second
scourge of vengeance.... It would be intolerable that any such
districts should meet the fate meted out to Macedonia in 1878. There is
no ground for such restoration except the claim arising from the
continued Turkish possessions of Adrianople. But compensation for the
brief period during which Adrianople may still be defended would be
represented by a district adjoining Chatalja, not exceeding, at all
events, the vilayet of Constantinople....</p>

<p>It is clearly our duty to call attention to the governing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
principle laid down by Lord Salisbury that any
district liberated from Turkish rule should not be restored
to misgovernment.... The ostensible ground
for the action of Europe, and particularly of England in
1878, was that the Powers themselves undertook the
reform of Turkish government in the restored provinces.
They have since that day persistently restrained the
small States from undertaking reform or liberation,
while notoriously neglecting the task themselves. The
promise to undertake reform was regarded in 1878 in
many quarters as sincere. But renewed restoration of
Christian districts to Turkey to-day would, after the
experiences of the past, be devoid of any shred of
sincerity....</p>

<p>The restoration of European and civilised populations
to Turkish rule would be resented now, not merely by
those who have sympathised with the Balkan Committee,
but by the entire public, which recognises that the
Allies have achieved a feat of arms of which even the
greatest Power would be proud.</p></blockquote>

<p class="p2b">In 1914 no more was heard of "Lord Salisbury's
principle," and in public repute the Balkan
States were in a position worse than any they had
occupied for half a century. Coming after a
successful war such a result condemns most
strongly Balkan statesmen and <a id="diplomats"></a>diplomats.</p>

Roumanian diplomacy during 1912-13 was
subtle, wily, and unscrupulous, enough to delight
a Machiavelli. With all its ethical wickedness
it was the most stable element in the wild disorders
of 1913; was efficacious in insisting upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
peace: and imposed a sort of rough justice on
all parties. Grecian diplomacy was of the same
character as the Roumanian, but not so supremely
able. The difference, it appeared to me, was
that the Roumanian sought a grand advantage
with a humble air: the Greek would seek an
advantage, even a humble one, with a grand
air. A lofty dignity sits well on the diplomacy
which is backed by great force: there should
be something more humble in the bearing of the
diplomat relying upon subtle wiles. The Greek
is a little too conscious of his heroic past not to
spoil a little the working of his otherwise very
pliant diplomacy. The Serbian in diplomacy
was not so childish as the Bulgarian and a great
deal more amiable and modest. Europe has long
given the Serbian a bad reputation for bounce
and bluster. In the events of 1912-13 he did
nothing to earn such ill-repute. His work in the
field was done excellently and with little <i>réclame</i>.
In Conference he was not aggressive, but moderate,
and, in my experience, more truthful than other
Balkan types.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h4>THE TROUBLES OF A WAR CORRESPONDENT IN THE BALKANS</h4>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Being</span> a war correspondent with the Bulgarian
army gave one far better opportunities of studying
Balkan scenery and natural characteristics than
war operations. After getting through to Staff
headquarters at Stara Zagora and to Mustapha
Pasha, which was about twelve miles from the
operations against Adrianople, I found myself
a kind of prisoner of the censor, and recall putting
my complaint into writing on November 7:</p>

<blockquote><p>It is the dullest of posts, this, at the tail of an army
which is moving forward and doing brave deeds whilst
we are cooped up by the censor, thirsting for news, and
given an occasional bulletin which tells us just what it
is thought that we should be told. True, we are not
prisoners exactly. We may go out within a mile radius.
That is the rule which must be faithfully kept under
pain of being sent back to headquarters. Perhaps, now
and again, a desperate correspondent, thinking that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
would not be such a sad thing after all to be sent back
to headquarters, takes a generous view of what a mile
is. (Perhaps he has been used to Irish miles, which are
of the elastic kind; short when you pay a car fare, long,
very long, at other times.) But, supposing, with great
energy and at dread risk of being sent back to headquarters
a correspondent <i>has</i> walked one mile and one
yard; or his horse, which cannot read notices, has
unwittingly carried him on; and supposing that he has
made all kinds of brilliant observations, analysing a
speck of shining metal showing there, a puff of smoke
elsewhere, a flash, or a scar on the earth, still there remains
the censor. A courteous gentleman is the censor,
with a manner even deferential. He cuts off the head
of your news with the most malignant courtesy. "I
am sorry, my dear sir, but that refers to movements of
troops; it is forbidden. And that might be useful
to the enemy. Ah, that observation is excellent; but
it cannot go."</p>

<p>Afterwards, there remains in your mind an impression
of your wickedness in having troubled so amiable a
gentleman, and on your telegraph form nothing, just
nothing. Of course, if you like, you can pass along the
camp chatter, the stories brought in by Greeks anxious
to curry favour, the descriptions of the capture of
Constantinople by peasants whose first cousins were
staying at the Pera Hotel the day it happened. The
censor is too wise a gentleman to interfere with the
harmless amusement of sending that on. It does not
harm; it may entertain somebody.</p>

<p>So at the rear of the army, which is making the
Christian arm more respected than it has been for some
time in this Balkan Peninsula, we sit and growl. Those
of us who are convinced that we possess that supreme<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
capacity of a general "to see what is going on behind
the next hill" are particularly sad. There are so many
precious observations being wasted, theories which
cannot be expressed, sagacious "I told you so's" which
are smothered. We are at the rear of an army, and
endless trains of transport move on; and if we can by
chance catch the sound of a distant gun we are happy
for a day, since it suggests the real thing. Some of us
are optimists, and feel sure that we shall go forward
in a day or two; that we shall be allowed to see the
bombardment of Adrianople; if not that, then its
capture; if not that, then something. Others are
pessimists, and have gone home.</p>

<p>It is easy to understand the anxiety of the Bulgarians.
They are engaged in a big war. They know that some
of the Great Powers are watching its progress with something
more than interest and something less than
sympathy. It is their impression that they can beat
the Turks; but that afterwards they may have to meet
an attempt to neutralise their victory. So they are
anxious to mask every detail of their organisation.
Secrecy applies to the past as well as to the present and
the future. But it is very irritating; and one goes
home, or holds on in the hope that something better
will come after a time.</p>

<p>Meanwhile one may learn a little of the country and
its people&mdash;this country which has been riven by many
wars. The map&mdash;with its names in several languages&mdash;gives
indications of the wounds they inflicted. In
Bulgaria, too, it shows how determined is the nationality
of the people who have within a generation reasserted
their right to be a nation. They permit no Turkish
names to remain on their maps. Not only do the Arabic
characters go, but also the Turkish names. Eski<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
Sagrah, for example, gives place to the title it has on
the best English maps. "Sagrah" means in Turkish
a "dell," a place sheltered by a wood. "Eski" means
"old." The Bulgarian has changed that to Stara
Zagora, Bulgarian words with exactly the same significance.
He wishes to wipe away all traces of the defiling
hand of the Turk from his country, though tolerant of
his Turkish fellow-subjects.</p>

<p>Almost completely he succeeds, but not quite completely.
The Turkish sweetmeats, the Turkish coffee
keep their hold on the taste of the people, and away
from the towns, among the peasants who till rich fields
with wooden ploughs, there remain traces of the Eastern
disregard for time. But even in the country the people
are waking up to modern ideas, aroused in part by the
American "drummer" selling agricultural machinery.
But in his city of Sofia, "the little Paris," as he likes to
hear it called, and in his towns the Bulgarian has become
keen and bustling. He rather aspires to be thought
Parisian in manner. A "middle class" begins to grow
up. The Bulgarian prospers mightily as a trader, and
when he makes money he devotes his son to a profession,
to the staff of the army, the law, to public life. Also
the Bulgarian is keen to add manufacturing industries
to his agricultural resources, and there are cotton mills
and other factories springing up in different places. The
Bulgarian has a great faith in himself. Thinking over
what he has done within forty years, it is easy to share
that belief and to think of him one day with a great
seaport on the Mediterranean aspiring to a place in the
family council of Europe.</p></blockquote>

<p>Afterwards, when by dint of hard begging,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
hard travelling, hard living, and some hard
swearing, I had forced my way through to the
front, I concluded that with the exception of
Mustapha Pasha&mdash;where the Second Army had
failed at its task and was set to work on a dull
siege, and was consequently very bad-tempered&mdash;the
famous censorship of the Bulgarian Army
was not so vexatious to the correspondents as
to their editors. The censors were usually polite,
and tried to make a difficult position agreeable.</p>

<p>When the correspondents were despatched
it was thought that the Balkan States, needing
a "good Press," would be fairly kind. The
expectation was realised in the case of the
Montenegrins and the Greeks. The Serbians
allowed the correspondents to see nothing. The
Bulgarian idea was to allow nothing to be seen
and nothing to be despatched except the "Te
Deums." It was an aggravation of the Japanese
censorship, and if it is accepted as a model for
future combatant States the "war correspondent"
will become extinct. I am not disposed to claim
that an army in the field should carry on its
operations under the eyes of newspaper correspondents;
and there were special circumstances
in regard to the campaign of the Bulgarian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
army (which was a desperate rush against a
big people of a little people operating with the
slenderest of resources) that made a severe
censorship absolutely necessary. But, that
allowed, there are still some points of criticism
justified.</p>

<p>One correspondent, and one only, was exempted
from censorship, and he was not at the front
but at Sofia. His special position as an informal
member of the Cabinet led to a concession which,
to a man of honour, was more of a responsibility
than a privilege. At the outset the Russian
and French correspondents were highly favoured,
and two English correspondents&mdash;who were
working jointly&mdash;were granted passes of credit
to all the armies. That privilege was afterwards
granted to me towards the end of the war. It
should have been granted to all or none. A
censorship which is harsh but has no favouritism
may be criticised, but it cannot be held suspect.
Throughout the campaign there was some
favouritism, the Russians having first place, the
French next, the English and Americans next,
the Italians, Germans, Austrians, and others
coming last. The differentiation between nations
was comprehensible enough, in view of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
political situation in Europe, but differentiations
between different papers of equal standing
of the same country cannot be defended. As
I ended the campaign one of the three favoured
English correspondents, I speak on this point
without bitterness. Indeed, I found no valid
grounds for abusing the censorship until just as
I was leaving Sofia, when I found that some of
my messages from Kirk Kilisse to the <i>Morning
Post</i> had been seriously (and, it would seem,
deliberately) mutilated <i>after</i> they had passed the
censor. They were of some importance as sent&mdash;one
the first account from the Bulgarian side
of the battle of Chatalja, the other a frank
statement of the position following that battle,
which I did not submit to the censor until after
close consultation with high authority, and which
was passed then with some modifications, and,
after being passed, was mutilated until it had
little or no meaning.</p>

</div>

<p class="p2">In lighter vein I may record some of the
humours of the censorship, mostly from Mustapha
Pasha, where the Second Army was held up and
everybody was in the worst of tempers. Mustapha
Pasha would not allow ox wagons to be
mentioned, would not allow photographs of
reservists to be sent forward because they were
not in full uniform, would not allow the fact
that Serbian troops were before Adrianople to
be recorded. Indeed, the censorship there was
full of strange prohibitions. Going down to
Mustapha Pasha I noticed aeroplane equipment.
The censor objected to that being recorded
then, though two days after the official bulletin
trumpeted the fact.</p>

<p>At Mustapha Pasha the custom was after the
war correspondent had written a despatch to
bring it to the censor, who held his court in a
room surrounded by a crowd of correspondents.
The censor insisted that the correspondent should
read the despatch aloud to him. Then the censor
read it over again aloud to him to make sure that
all heard. Thus we all learned how the other
man's imagination was working, and telegraphing
was reduced to a complete farce. Private letters
had to pass through the same ordeal, and one
correspondent, with a turn of humour, wrote an
imaginary private letter full of the most fervent
love messages, which was read out to a furiously
blushing censor and to a batch of journalists,
who at first did not see the joke and tried to look
as if they were not listening. I have described<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
the early days of Mustapha Pasha. Later, when
most of the men had gone away, conditions
improved.</p>

<p>The "second censorship"&mdash;the most disingenuous
and condemnable part of the Bulgarian
system&mdash;was applied with full force to Mustapha
Pasha. After correspondents, who were forbidden
to go a mile out of the town and forbidden to
talk with soldiers, had passed their pitiful little
messages through the censor, those messages were
not telegraphed, but posted on to the Staff headquarters
and then censored again, sometimes
stopped. Certes, the treasures of strategical
observation and vivid description thus lost were
not very great, but the whole proceeding was unfair
and underhand. The censor's seal once affixed
a message should go unchanged. Otherwise it
might be twisted into actual false information.</p>

<p>In almost all cases the individual censors were
gentlemen, and personally I never had trouble
with any of them; but the system was faulty
at the outset, inasmuch as it was not frank, and
was made worse when it became necessary to
change the plan of campaign and abandon the
idea of capturing Adrianople. Then the Press
correspondents who had been allowed down to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
Mustapha Pasha in the expectation that after
two days they would be permitted to follow the
victorious army into Adrianople, had to be kept
in that town, and had to be prevented from knowing
anything of what was going on. The courageous
course would have been to have put them
under a definite embargo for a period. That
was not followed, and the same end was sought
by a series of irritating tricks and evasions.
The facts argue against the continuance of the
war correspondent. An army really can never
be sure of its victory until the battle is over. If
it allows the journalists to come forward to see
an expected victory and the victory does not
come, then awkward facts are necessarily disclosed,
and the moving back of those correspondents
is tantamount to a confession of a
movement of retreat. If I were a general in
the field I should allow no war correspondents
with the troops except reliable men, who would
agree to see the war out, to send no despatches
until the conclusion of an operation, and to observe
any interdiction which might be necessary then.
Under these circumstances there would be very
few correspondents, but there would be no deceit
and no ill-feeling.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>The holding up of practically all private
telegraphic messages by the authorities at the
front was a real grievance. It was impossible
to communicate with one's office to get instructions.
One correspondent, arriving at Sofia at
the end of the campaign, found that he had been
recalled a full month before. The unnecessary
mystery about the locality of Staff headquarters
added to the difficulty of keeping in touch with
one's office.</p>

<p>The Bulgarian people made some "bad
friends" on the Press because of the censorship;
but the sore feeling was not always justifiable.
The worst that can be said is that the military
authorities did in rather a weak and disingenuous
way what they should have had the moral
courage to do in a firm way at the outset. The
Bulgarian enterprise against the Turks was so
audacious, the need of secrecy in regard to
equipment was so pressing, that there was no
place for the journalist. Under the circumstances
a nation with more experience of affairs and more
confidence in herself would have accredited no
correspondents. Bulgaria sought the same end
as that which would have served secrecy by
an evasive way. Englishmen, with centuries of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
greatness to give moral courage, may not complain
too harshly when the circumstances of this
new-come nation are considered.</p>

<p>When the army of Press correspondents were
gathered, it was seen that there were several
Austrians and Roumanians, and these countries
were at the time threatening mobilisation
against the Balkan States. It was impossible
to expect that the Bulgarian forces should allow
Roumanian journalists and Austrian journalists
to see anything of their operations which might
be useful to Austria or Roumania in a future
campaign. Yet it would not have been proper
to have allowed correspondents other than the
Austrians and Roumanians to go to the front,
because that would perhaps have created a
diplomatic question, which would have increased
the tension. It certainly would have given
offence to Austria and to Roumania. It would
have been said that there was an idea that
war was intended against those nations; and
diplomacy was anxious to avoid giving expression
to any such idea. The military attachés
were in exactly the same position.</p>

<p>There were the Austrian attaché and the
Roumanian attaché, and their duty was to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
report to their Governments all they could
find out that would be to the advantage of
the military forces of their Governments. The
Bulgarians naturally would not allow the
Roumanian nor the Austrian attaché to see anything
of what went on. The attachés were even
worse treated than the correspondents, because,
as the campaign developed, the Bulgarians got
to understand that some of us were trustworthy,
and we were given certain facilities for seeing.
But we were still without facilities for the despatch
of what we had seen. But the military attachés
were kept right in the rear all the time. They
were taken over the battle-fields after the battles
had been fought, so that they might see what
victories had been gained by the Bulgarians.</p>

<p>The Bulgarians were much strengthened in
their attitude towards the war correspondents
by the fact that they admitted receiving much
help in their operations from the news published
in London and in French newspapers from the
Turkish side. The Turkish army, when the period
of rout began, was in the position that it was able
to exercise little check on its war correspondents;
and the Bulgarians had everything which was
recorded as being done in the Turkish army<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
sent on to them. They said it was a great help
to them. I think the outlook for war correspondents
in the future is a gloomy one, and the
outlook for the military attaché also. In the
future, no army carrying on anything except
minor operations with savage nations, no army
whose interests might be vitally affected by information
leaking out, is likely to allow military
attachés or war correspondents to see anything
at all.</p>

<p>The Balkan War probably will close the book
of the war correspondent. It was in the wars of
the "Near East" that that book was first opened
in the modern sense. Some of the greatest
achievements of the craft were in the Crimean
War, the various Turco-Russian wars, and the
Greco-Turkish struggle. It is an incidental proof
of the popularity of the Balkan Peninsula as a
war theatre that the history of the profession
of the war correspondent would be a record
almost wholly of wars in the Near East.</p>

<p>Certainly if the "war correspondent" is to
survive he will need to be of a new type. I
came to that conclusion when I returned to Kirk
Kilisse from the Bulgarian lines at Chatalja,
and had amused myself in an odd hour with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
burrowing among a great pile of newspapers in
the censor's office, and reading here and there
the war news from English, French, and Belgian
papers.</p>

<p class="p2b">Dazed, dismayed, I recognised that I had
altogether mistaken the duties of a war correspondent.
For some six weeks I had been following
an army in breathless anxious chase of facts:
wheedling censors to get some few of those facts
into a telegraph office; learning then, perhaps,
that the custom at that particular telegraph
office was to forward telegrams to Sofia, a ten
days' journey, by bullock wagon and railway,
to give them time to mature. Now here, piping
hot, were the stories of the war. There was the
touching prose poem about King Ferdinand
following his troops to the front in a military
train, which was his temporary palace. One
part of the carriage, serving as his bed-chamber,
was taken up with a portrait of his mother, and
to that picture he looked ever for encouragement,
for advice, for praise. Had there been that day
a "Te Deum" for a great victory? He looked
at the picture and added, "Te <a id="Matrem"></a>Matrem."</p>

</div>

<p class="p2">It was a beautiful story, and why should any
one let loose a brutal bulldog of a fact and point<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
out that King Ferdinand during the campaign
lived in temporary palaces at Stara Zagora and
Kirk Kilisse, and when he travelled on a visit
to some point near the front it was usually by
motor-car?</p>

<p>In a paper of another nationality there was
a vivid story of the battle of Chatalja. This
story started the battle seven days too soon;
had the positions and the armies all wrong;
the result all wrong; and the picturesque details
were in harmony. But for the purposes of the
public it was a very good story of a battle. Those
men who, after great hardships, were enabled
to see the actual battle found that the poor
messages which the censor permitted them to
send took ten days or more in transmission to
London. Why have taken all the trouble and
expense of going to the front? Buda-Pest, on
the way there, is a lovely city; Bucharest also;
and charming Vienna was not at all too far away
if you had a good staff map and a lively military
imagination.</p>

<p>In yet another paper there was a vivid picture&mdash;scenery,
date, Greenwich time, and all to give
an air of artistic verisimilitude&mdash;of the signing
of the Peace armistice. The armistice had not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
been signed at the time, was not signed for some
days after. But it would have been absurd to
have waited, since "our special correspondent"
had seen it all in advance, right down to the
embrace of the Turkish delegate and the Bulgarian
delegate, and knew that some of the conditions
were that the Turkish commissariat was to feed
the Bulgarian troops at Chatalja and the Bulgarian
commissariat the Turkish troops in Adrianople.
If his paper had waited for the truth that most
charming story would never have seen the
light.</p>

<p>So, in a little book I shall one day bring out
in the "Attractive Occupations" series on "How
to be a War Correspondent," I shall give this
general advice:</p>

<p>1. Before operations begin, visit the army
to which you are accredited, and take notes of
the general appearance of officers and men. Also
learn a few military phrases of their language.
Ascertain all possible particulars of a personal
character concerning the generals and chief
officers.</p>

<p>2. Return then to a base outside the country.
It must have good telegraph communication with
your newspaper. For the rest you may decide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
its locality by the quality of the wine, or the
beer, or the cooking.</p>

<p>3. Secure a set of good maps of the scene of
operations. It will be handy also to have any
books which have been published describing
campaigns over the same <i>terrain</i>.</p>

<p>4. Keep in touch with the official bulletins
issued by the military authorities from the scene
of operations. But be on guard not to become
enslaved by them. If, for instance, you wait
for official notices of battles, you will be much
hampered in your picturesque work. Fight
battles when they ought to be fought and how
they ought to be fought. The story's the thing.</p>

<p>5. A little sprinkling of personal experience
is wise: for example, a bivouac on the battle-field,
toasting your bacon at a fire made of a broken-down
gun carriage with a bayonet taken from a
dead soldier. Mention the nationality of the
bacon. You cannot be too precise in details.</p>

<p>Ko-Ko's account of the execution of Nankipoo
is, in short, the model for the future war correspondent.
The other sort of war correspondent,
who patiently studied and recorded operations,
seems to be doomed. In the nature of things
it must be so. The more competent and the more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
accurate he is, the greater the danger he is to
the army which he accompanies. His despatches,
published in his newspaper and telegraphed
promptly to the other side, give to them at a
cheap cost that information of what is going on
<i>behind</i> their enemy's screen of scouts which is
so vital to tactical, and sometimes to strategical,
dispositions. To try to obtain that information
an army pours out much blood and treasure;
to guard that information an army will consume
a full third of its energies in an elaborate system
of mystification. A modern army must either
banish the war correspondent altogether or subject
him to such restrictions of censorship as to veto
honest, accurate, and prompt criticism or record
of operations.</p>

<p>Some of the correspondents&mdash;one in particular&mdash;overcame
a secretive military system and a
harsh censorship by the use of a skilled imagination,
and of a friendly telegraph line outside the
area of censorship. At the Staff headquarters
at Stara Zagora during the early days of the
campaign, when we were all straining at the leash
to get to the front, waiting and fussing, he was
working, reconstructing the operations with maps
and a fine imagination, and never allowing his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
paper to want for news. I think that he was
quite prepared to have taken pupils for his new
school of war correspondents. Often he would
come to me for a yarn&mdash;in halting French on
both sides&mdash;and would explain the campaign as
it was being carried on. One eloquent gesture
he habitually had&mdash;a sweeping motion which
brought his arms together as though they were
gathering up a bundle of spears, then the hands
would meet in an expressive squeeze. "It is
that," he said, "it is Napoleonic."</p>

<p>Probably the censor at this stage did not
interfere much with his activities, content enough
to allow fanciful descriptions of Napoleonic
strategy to go to the outer world. But, in my
experience, facts, if one ascertained something
independently, were not treated kindly.</p>

<p>"Why not?" I asked the censor vexedly
about one message he had stopped. "It is
true."</p>

<p>"Yes, that is the trouble," he said,&mdash;the
nearest approach to a joke I ever got out of a
Bulgarian, for they are a sober, God-fearing, and
humour-fearing race.</p>

<p>The idea of the Bulgarian censorship in regard
to the privileges and duties of the war correspondent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
was further illustrated to me on another
occasion when a harmless map of a past phase
of the campaign was stopped.</p>

<p>"Then what am I to send?" I asked.</p>

<p>"There are the bulletins," he said.</p>

<p>"Yes, the bulletins which are just your bald
official account of week-old happenings which are
sent to every news agency in Europe before we
see them!"</p>

<p>"But you are a war correspondent. You
can add to them in your own language."</p>

<p>Remembering that conversation, I suspect
that at first the Bulgarian censorship did not
object to fairy tales passing over the wires, though
the way was blocked for exact observation. An
enterprising story-maker had not very serious
difficulties at the outset. Afterwards there was
a change, and even the writer of fairy stories
had to work outside the range of the censor.</p>

<p>The Mustapha Pasha censorship would not
allow ox wagons, reservists, or Serbians to be
mentioned, nor officers' names. The censorship
objected, too, for a long time to any mention of
the all-pervading mud which was the chief item
of interest in the town's life. Yet you might have
lost an army division in some of the puddles.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
(But stop, I am lapsing into the picturesque ways
of the new school of correspondents. Actually
you could not have lost more than a regiment
in the largest mud puddle.)</p>

<p>Let the position be frankly faced that if one
is with an army in modern warfare, common
sense prohibits the authorities from allowing
you to see anything, and suggests the further
precautions of a strict censorship and a general
hold-up of wires until their military value (and
therefore their "news" value) has passed. If
your paper wants picturesque stories hot off the
grill it is much better not to be with the army
(which means in effect in the rear of the army),
but to write about its deeds from outside the
radius of the censorship.</p>

<p>Perhaps, though, your paper has old-fashioned
prejudices in favour of veracity, and will be
annoyed if your imagination leads you too palpably
astray? In that case do not venture to be a
war correspondent at all. If you do not invent,
you will send nothing of value. If you invent
you will be reprimanded.</p>

<p>Here is my personal record of "getting to the
front" and the net result of the trouble and the
expense. I went down to Mustapha Pasha with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
the great body of war correspondents and soon
recognised that there was no hope of useful
work there. The attacking army was at a stand-still,
and a long, wearisome siege&mdash;its operations
strictly guarded from inspection&mdash;was in prospect.
I decided to get back to Staff headquarters (then
at Stara Zagora) and just managed to catch the
Staff before it moved on to Kirk Kilisse. By
threatening to return to London at once I got
a promise of leave to join the Third Army and to
"see some fighting."</p>

<p>The promise anticipated the actual granting
of leave by two days. It would be tedious to
record all the little and big difficulties that were
then encountered through the reluctance of the
military authorities to allow one to get transport
or help of any kind. But four days later I was
marching out of Mustapha Pasha on the way to
Kirk Kilisse by way of Adrianople, a bullock
wagon carrying my baggage, an interpreter
trundling my bicycle, I riding a small pony.
The interpreter was gloomy and disinclined to
face the hardships and dangers (mostly fancied)
of the journey. Beside the driver (a Macedonian)
marched a soldier with fixed bayonet. Persuasion
was necessary to force the driver to undertake
the journey and a friendly transport officer had,
with more or less legality, put at my command
this means of argument. A mile outside Mustapha
Pasha the soldier turned back and I was left to
coax my unwilling helpers on a four days' journey
across a war-stricken countryside, swept of all
supplies, infested with savage dogs (fortunately
well-fed by the harvest of the battle-fields),
liable to ravage by roving bands.</p>

<span class="caption">GENERAL SAVOFF</span>
</div>

<p class="p2">That night I gave the Macedonian driver
some jam and some meat to eke out his bread
and cheese.</p>

<p>"That is better than having a bayonet poked
into your inside," I said, by pantomime. He
understood, grinned, and gave no great trouble
thereafter, though he was always in a state
of pitiable funk when I left the wagon to
take a trip within the lines of the besieging
forces.</p>

<p>So to Kirk Kilisse. There I got to General
Savoff himself and won not only leave, but a
letter of aid to go down to the Third Army at
the lines of Chatalja. But by then what must
be the final battle of the war was imminent.
Every hour of delay was dangerous. To go by
cart meant a journey of several days. A military<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
train was available part of the way if I were
content to drop interpreter, horse, and baggage,
and travel with a soldier's load.</p>

<p>That decision was easy enough at the moment&mdash;though
I sometimes regretted it afterwards
when the only pair of riding breeches I had with
me gave out at the knees and I had to walk the
earth ragged&mdash;and by train I got to Chorlu.
There a friendly artillery officer helped me to get
a cart (springless) and two fast horses. He insisted
also on giving me a patrol, a single Bulgarian
soldier, with 200 rounds of ammunition, as
Bashi-Bazouks were ranging the country.</p>

<p>It was an unnecessary precaution, though the
presence of the soldier was comforting as we
entered Silviri at night, the outskirts of the town
deserted, the chattering of the driver's teeth
audible over the clamour of the cart, the gutted
houses ideal refuges for prowling bands. From
Silviri to Chatalja there was again no appearance
of Bashi-Bazouks. But thought of another
danger obtruded as we came near the lines and
encountered men from the Bulgarian army suffering
from the choleraic dysentery which had then
begun its ravages. To one dying soldier by the
roadside I gave brandy; and then had to leave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
him with his mates, who were trying to get him
to a hospital. They were sorely puzzled by his
cries, his pitiful grimaces. Wounds they knew
and the pain of them they despised. They
could not comprehend this disease which took
away all the manhood of a stoic peasant and
made him weak in spirit as an ailing child.</p>

<p>From Chatalja, the right flank of the Bulgarian
position, I passed along the front to Ermenikioi
("the village of Armenians"), passing the night
at Arjenli, near the centre and the headquarters
of the ammunition park. That night at Arjenli
seemed to make a rough and sometimes perilous
journey, which had extended over seven days,
worth while. The Commander, an artillery
officer, welcomed me to a little mess which the
Bulgarian officers and non-commissioned officers
(six in all) had set up in a clean room of a village
house. We had dinner, "Turkish fashion,"
squatting round a dish of stewed goat and rice,
and then smoked excellent cigarettes through the
evening hours as we looked out on the Chatalja
lines.</p>

<p>Arjenli is perched on a high hill, to the west
of Ermenikioi. It gave a view of all the Chatalja
position&mdash;the range of hills stretching from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
Black Sea to the Sea of Marmora, along which
the Bulgarians were entrenched, and, beyond the
invisible valley, the second range which held the
Turkish defence. Over the Turkish lines, like
a standard, shone in the clear sky a crescent
moon, within its tip a bright star. It seemed
an omen, an omen of good to the Turks.
My Australian eye instinctively sought for the
Southern Cross ranged against it in the sky in
sign that the Christian standard held the Heavens
too. I sought in vain in those northern latitudes,
shivered a little and, as though arguing against
a superstitious thought, said to myself: "But
there is the Great Bear."</p>

<p>Now there had been "good copy" in the
journey. At Arjenli I happened to be the witness
of a vivid dramatic scene (more stirring than
any battle incident). It was a splendid incident,
showing the high courage and <i>moral</i> of these
peasant soldiers at an anxious time. To have
witnessed it, participated in it, was personal
reward sufficient for a week of toil and anxiety.
To my paper, too, the reader might say, it was of
some value, if properly told and given to the
London reader the next morning, the day before
the battle of Chatalja.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
Yes. But it was the next afternoon before I
could get to a telegraph office within the Bulgarian
lines. Then the censor said any long message
was hopeless. I was allowed to send a bare
100 words. They reached London eight days
later, a week after the battle had been fought,
when London was interested no longer in anything
but the armistice negotiations. The reason
was that the single telegraph line was monopolised
for military business. My account of the
battle of Chatalja reached London a full fortnight
after the event, though I had the advantage
of the highest influence to expedite the
message.</p>

<p>Thus from a daily-newspaper point of view
all the expense, toil, danger were wasted.</p>

<p>Summing up, an accurate and prompt Press
service as war correspondent with the Bulgarian
army was impossible, because&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The Bulgarian authorities were keen that
correspondents should see nothing.</p>

<p>2. A rigid first censorship checked a full
record of what little was seen.</p>

<p>3. The first censorship being passed, despatches
often had still to pass a second censorship at
Staff headquarters, a third censorship at Sofia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
4. Despatches passing through Roumania
underwent another censorship there, and yet
another in Austria, possibly yet others in other
European countries.</p>

<p>5. In addition to these censorship delays the
Bulgarian authorities made newspaper messages
yield precedence to military messages, and at
the front this meant that Press messages were
sent on by mail (ox transport most of the
way) to the Staff headquarters or the capital.</p>

<p>6. In the meanwhile the imaginative accounts
written nearer Fleet Street had been published,
and the accurate news was "dead" from a point
of public interest.</p>

<p class="p2b">Most of these conditions will rule over all
future wars. Therefore I conclude that the day
of the war correspondent&mdash;in the sense of a
truthful observer of a campaign&mdash;has gone, and
he died with the Balkan War. He can only
survive if newspapers are willing to incur the
very great expense of sending out war correspondents
not for the news, day by day, but for
what observation and criticism they could supply
after the campaign was over. To a daily newspaper
such matter is almost valueless, especially
as during the progress of the campaign the correspondents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
of the "new" school would be at work
with their many inventions, raising the hair of
the public and the circulation of their journals
with bright feats of imagination.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h4>JOTTINGS FROM MY BALKAN TRAVEL BOOK</h4>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">These</span> observations I will quote from my diary
during 1912 in illustration of phases of Balkan
character, dating them at the time and place
that they were made.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Belgrade</span>, <i>October 21</i>.&mdash;The declaration of
war has not set the Serbians singing in the streets.
In the chief café there is displayed a great war
map. Young soldiers not yet sent to the front
lounge about in all the cafés and are lionised
by the older men. They are the only signs of
war.</p>

<p class="centerb">BULGARIAN INFANTRY</p>
</div>

<p class="p2">The patriotic Serbian illustrates his case
against the Turk by taking you for a ramble
around his capital. The old Turkish quarters
of the town are made up of narrow unpaved
muddy lanes lined with low hovels. The modern
Serbian town has handsome buildings markedly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
Russian in architecture, electric trams, and wood-blocked
pavements. Near the railway station
one side of a street is as the Turks left it and
shows a row of hovels: the other side is occupied
by a great school. The shops, because it is war-time
and business is largely suspended, are
mostly closed. But a few remain open with
reduced staffs. The goods displayed are as a
rule woefully expensive when they are not of
local origin. Landlocked Serbia, surrounded by
commercially hostile countries, finds imports expensive.
British goods are very much favoured,
but are hard to obtain.</p>

<p>The Serbians speak bitterly of the efforts of
Austria "to strangle them commercially."
"Whenever they wish to put diplomatic pressure
upon us," said one Serbian to me, "they discover
that swine fever has broken out in our country
and stop our exports of pigs and bacon&mdash;our
chief lines of export. What can we do? Once,
in retaliation, we found that we suspected a
consignment of Austrian linen goods of carrying
swine fever and stopped it on the frontier. It
almost caused war."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nish</span> (Serbia), <i>October 22</i>.&mdash;A military train
carrying some members of the army and Staff<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
has brought also a band of war correspondents
this far. We were a merry but rather a hungry
lot. The train has been sixteen hours on the
journey, and as we started at 6 a.m. most of us
did not bring any stores of food except such as
were packed away and inaccessible in the big
baggage. The wayside refreshment rooms are
swept clean of all food. Finally we manage to
obtain some bread, and five hungry correspondents
in one carriage eat at it without enthusiasm,
whilst in a corner sits a Serbian officer having
a good meal of sausage and onions and bread.
We make remarks, a little envious, a little jocose,
in English, on his selfishness. "He is a greedy
pig, anyhow," said one, putting the final cap
on our grumbles. The Serbian officer had not
betrayed by a smile or a frown that he understood
but now in good English he remarked: "Perhaps
you gentlemen will be so kind as to share this
with me." We all laughed and he laughed then:
and we took a little of the sausage, and liked
that Serbian rather well: and no reference was
made to what had gone before. At nightfall
we stop at Nish and all my Press comrades leave
the train to go on in the rear of the Serbian
army. I push on to Sofia. Clearly these Balkan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
peoples are not quite so savage as I had thought
once.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sofia</span>, <i>October 24</i>.&mdash;The position of the
Bulgarian nation towards its Government on
the outbreak of the war is, I think, extremely
interesting as a lesson in patriotism. Every
man has gone to fight who could fight. But
further, every family has put its surplus of goods
into the war-chest. The men marched away to
the front; and the women of the house loaded
up the surplus goods which they had in the house,
and brought them for the use of the military
authorities on the ox wagons, which also went to
the military authorities to be used on requisition.
A Bulgarian law, not one which was passed on
the outbreak of the war&mdash;they were far too
clever for that,&mdash;but a law which was part of the
organic law of the country, allowed the military
authorities to requisition all surplus food and all
surplus goods which could be of value to the
army on the outbreak of hostilities.</p>

<p>The whole machinery for that had been provided
beforehand. But so great was the voluntary
patriotism of the people that this machinery
practically has not had to be used in any compulsory
form. Goods were brought in voluntarily,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
wagons, cart-horses and oxen, and all the surplus
flour and wheat, and&mdash;I have the official figures
from the Bulgarian Treasurer&mdash;those goods which
were obtained in this way totalled in value some
six million pounds. That represented the surplus
goods, beyond those necessary for consumption
by the Bulgarian people, at the outset of the war.
The numbers of the Bulgarian people represent
half the population of London. The peasant
population is very poor. Their national existence
dates back only half a century. But they are
very frugal and saving; that six millions which
the Government signed for represented practically
all the savings which the Bulgarian people had at
the outbreak of the war. I am told that the gold
supply in the Bulgarian Treasury at the declaration
of war was only three million pounds. So
that there was an army of 350,000 men put into
the field, and only three million pounds as the
gold supply.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kirk Kilisse</span>, <i>November 7</i>.&mdash;The extraordinary
simplicity of the commissariat has helped the
Bulgarian generals a great deal. The men have
had bread and cheese, sometimes even bread
alone; and that was accounted a satisfactory
ration. When meat and other things could be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
obtained, they were obtained; but there were
long periods when the Bulgarian soldier had
nothing but bread and water. The water, unfortunately,
he took wherever he could get it,
by the side of the route at any stream he could
find. There was no attempt to ensure a pure
water supply for the army. I do not think that,
without that simplicity of commissariat, it would
have been possible for the Bulgarian forces to
have got as far as they did. There was an entire
absence of tinned foods. As I travelled in the
trail of the Bulgarian army, I found it impossible
to imagine that an army had passed that way,
because there was none of the litter which is
usually left by an army. It was not that they
cleared away their rubbish with them; it simply
did not exist. Their bread and cheese seems to
be a good fighting diet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Seleniki</span>, <i>November 13</i>.&mdash;The transport was,
naturally, the great problem which faced the
generals. I have seen here (Seleniki, which is
the point at which the rail-head is), within 30
miles of Constantinople as the crow flies, ox
wagons which have come from the Shipka Pass
in the north of Bulgaria. I asked one driver
how long it had been on the road; he told me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
three weeks. He was carrying food down to the
front. The way the ox wagons were used for
transport was a marvel of organisation. A
transport officer at Mustapha Pasha, with whom
I became very friendly, was lyrical in his praise
of the ox wagon. It was, he said, the only thing
that stuck to him during the war. The railway
got choked, and even the horse failed, but the
ox never failed. There were thousands of ox
wagons crawling across the country. They do
not walk, they crawl, like an insect, with an
irresistible crawl. It reminds you of those armies
of soldier ants which move across Africa, eating
everything which they come across, and stopping
at nothing. I had an ox wagon coming from
Mustapha Pasha to Kirk Kilisse, and we went over
the hills and down through the valleys, and stopped
for nothing&mdash;we never had to unload once. And
one could sleep in those ox wagons. There is
no jolting and pulling at the traces, such as
you get with a harnessed horse. The ox wagon
moved slowly; but it always moved. If the
ox transport had not been as perfectly organised,
and if the oxen had not been as patiently enduring
as they proved to be, the Bulgarian army
must have perished by starvation. And yet, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
Mustapha Pasha, a censor would not allow us
to send anything about the ox wagons. That
officer thought the ox cart was derogatory to the
dignity of the army. If we had been able to
say that they had such things as motor transport
or steam wagons, he would have cheerfully
allowed us to send it.</p>

<p>But after Lule Burgas, the ox transport has
had to do the impossible. It is impossible for it
to maintain the food and the ammunition supply
of the army at the front, which I suppose must
number 250,000 to 300,000 men. That army
has got right away from its base, with the one
line of railway straddled by the enemy, and with
the ox as practically the only means of transport.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Arjenli</span> (Turkey), <i>November 15, 1912</i>.&mdash;It
is Friday, and we expect to-morrow the Battle
of Chatalja. In the little Turkish village of
Arjenli, situated on a high hill a little to the
rear of the Bulgarian lines, is the ammunition
park of the artillery, guarded by a small body
of troops under Lieutenant-Colonel Tchobanoff.
Coming towards the front from Chorlu, the fall
of night and the weariness of my horses have
compelled me to halt at Arjenli, and this officer
and Dr. Neytchef give me a warm welcome to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
their little mess. There are six members, and for
all, to sleep and to eat, one room. Three are
officers, three have no commissions. With this
nation in arms that is not an objection to a common
table. Discipline is strict, but officers and soldiers
are men and brothers when out of the ranks.
Social position does not govern military position.
I found sometimes the University professor and
the bank manager without commissions, the
peasant proprietor an officer. The whole nation
has poured out its manhood for the war, from
farm, field, factory, shop, bank, university, and
consulting-room.</p>

<p>Here, at Arjenli, on the eve of the decisive battle,
I think over early incidents of the campaign. It
is a curious fact that in all Bulgaria I have met
but one man who was young enough and well
enough to fight and who had not enlisted. He
had become an American subject, I believe, and
so could not be compelled to serve. In America
he had learned to be an "International Socialist,"
and so he did not volunteer. I believe he was
unique. With half the population of London,
Bulgaria had put 350,000 trained men under
arms. But there was in the nation one good
Socialist who knew that war was an evil thing,
and that it was better to sit down meekly under
tyranny than to take up arms.</p>

<p class="centerb">OX TRANSPORT IN THE BALKANS</p>
</div>

<p class="p2">I followed in the track of the victorious Third
Army as it came down through the border
mountains on to Kirk Kilisse, then to Lule Burgas,
then past Chorlu to the Chatalja lines. At
Arjenli I had overtaken them in time to see the
final battle, and now sat looking out on the entrenched
armies, talking over the position with
a serene and cheerful artillery officer. The past
week had been one of hardship and horrors.
From Chorlu the road was lined with the bodies
of the Turkish dead, still awaiting burial. Entering
the Bulgarian lines on their right flank that
morning, I had tried in vain to succour a soldier
dying of the choleraic dysentery which had begun
its ravages. But here in the middle of the battle
line the atmosphere of noble confidence is inspiriting.
The horrors of war vanish; only its
glory shows. The men around me feel that they
are engaged in a just war. They know that
everything that man can do has been done.
Proudly, cheerfully, they await the issue.</p>

<p>During the evening, a Turk suspected of being
a spy is brought in for trial. He had attempted
to rush past one of the sentries guarding the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
ammunition wagons. He is given a patient
hearing, is able to establish his innocence, and
is allowed to go. There is no feeling of panic
or injustice among these Bulgarians. I see the
trial and its end (having been asked to act as
friend of the accused).</p>

<p>It is to-day forty days since the mobilisation.
At the call this trained nation was in arms in a
day. The citizen soldiers hurried to the depots
for their arms and uniforms. In one district
the rumour that mobilisation had been authorised
was bruited abroad a day before the actual
issue of the orders, and the depot was besieged
by the peasants who had rushed in from their
farms. The officer in charge could not give out
the rifles, so the men lit fires, got food from the
neighbours, and camped around the depot until
they were armed. Some navvies received their
mobilisation orders on returning to their camp
after ten hours' work at railway-building. They
had supper and marched through the night to
their respective headquarters. For one soldier
the march was twenty-four miles. The railway
carriages were not adequate to bring all the men
to their assigned centres. Some rode on the
steps, on the roofs of carriages, on the buffers even.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>At Stara Zagora, early in November, I noted
a mother of the people who had come to see some
Turkish prisoners just brought in from Mustapha
Pasha. To one she gave a cake. "They are
hungry," she said. This woman had five men
at the war&mdash;her four sons in the fighting line, her
husband under arms guarding a line of communication.
She had sent them proudly. It
was the boast of the Bulgarian women that not
a tear was shed at the going away of the soldiers.</p>

<p>Later, at a little village outside Kirk Kilisse,
a young civil servant, an official of the Foreign
Office, spoke of the war whilst we ate a dish of
cheese and eggs. "It is a war," he said, "of
the peasants and the intellectuals. It is not a
war made by the politicians or the soldiers of
the Staff. That would be impossible. In our
nation every soldier is a citizen and every citizen
a soldier. There could not be a war unless it
were a war desired by the people. In my office
it was with rage that some of the clerks heard
that they must stay at Sofia, and not go to the
front. We were all eager to take arms."</p>

<p>At Nova Zagora, travelling by a troop train
carrying reserves to the front, I crossed a train
bringing wounded from the battle-fields. For
some hours both trains were delayed. The men
going to the front were decorated with flowers
as though going to a feast. They filled the
waiting time by dancing to the music of the
national bagpipes, and there joined in the dance
such of the wounded as could stand on their feet.
There was no daunting these trained patriots.</p>

<p>These and a score of other pictures pass through
my mind and explain Kirk Kilisse and Lule
Burgas, and give confidence for the battle to
come. Here was a people ranged for battle with
the steady nerves and the stolid courage that
come from tilling the soil, with the skill and the
discipline that come from adequate training,
with the fervent faith of a great patriotism. I
have talked with Turkish prisoners and found
infantrymen who had been sent to the front after
two days' training, gunners who had been drafted
into a battery after ten days' drill. Such soldiers
can only march to defeat.</p>

Battle of Chatalja has been opened. To-day,
General Demetrieff rode out with his Staff to the
battle-field whilst the bells of a Christian church
in this little village rang. The day was spent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
in artillery reconnaissance, the Bulgarian guns
searching the Turkish entrenchments to discover
their real strength. Only once during the day
was the infantry employed; and then it was
rather to take the place of artillery than to complete
work begun by artillery. It seems to me
that the Bulgarian forces have not enough big
gun ammunition at the front. They are ten days
from their base, and shells must come up by ox
wagon the greater part of the way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ermenikioi</span>, <i>November 18</i>.&mdash;This was a wild
day on the Chatalja hills. Driving rain and mist
swept over from the Black Sea, and at times
obscured all the valley across which the battle
raged. With but slight support from the artillery,
the Bulgarian infantry was sent again and again
up to the Turkish entrenchments. Once a fort
was taken but had to be abandoned again. The
result of the day's fighting is indecisive. The
Bulgarian forces have driven in the Turkish right
flank a little, but have effected nothing against
the central positions which bar the road to
Constantinople. It is clear that the artillery
is not well enough supplied with ammunition.
There is a sprinkle of shells when there should be
a flood. Gallant as is the infantry, it cannot win<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
much ground faced by conditions such as the Light
Brigade met at Balaclava.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ermenikioi</span>, <i>November 19</i>.&mdash;Operations have
been suspended. Yesterday's cold and bitter
weather has fanned to an epidemic the choleraic
dysentery which had been creeping through the
trenches. The casualties in the fighting had been
heavy. "But for every wounded man who
comes to the hospitals," Colonel Jostoff, the
Chief of the Staff, tells me, "there are ten who
say 'I am ill.'" The Bulgarians recognise
bitterly that in their otherwise fine organisation
there has been one flaw, the medical service.
Among this nation of peasant proprietors&mdash;sturdy,
abstemious, moral, living in the main on whole-meal
bread and water&mdash;illness was so rare that
the medical service was but little regarded. Up
to Chatalja confidence in the rude health of the
peasants was justified. They passed through
cold, hunger, fatigue, and kept healthy. But
ignorant of sanitary discipline, camped among
the filthy Turkish villages, the choleraic dysentery
passed from the Turkish trenches to theirs. There
are 30,000 cases of illness, and the healthy for
the first time feel fear as they see the torments
of the sick. The Bulgarians recognise that there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
must be a pause in the fighting whilst the hospital
and sanitary service is reorganised.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kirk Kilisse</span>, <i>December 1</i>.&mdash;It seems certain
now that peace must be declared, and that the
dream of driving the Turk right out of Europe
must be abandoned. These peasant peoples of
the Balkans have done wonderful things, but
they have stumbled on one point&mdash;the want of
knowledge of sanitary science. I have seen only
one attempt at a clean camp since I have been in
the field, and that was a Serbian camp, north
of Adrianople.</p>

<p>With the Bulgarian army there was not, at
any stage of the campaign up to the Battle of
Chatalja&mdash;that is, until after the outbreak of
cholera&mdash;any precaution, to my knowledge, taken
to secure a clean water supply, or clean camping-grounds,
or to take the most elementary precautions
against the outbreak of disease in the
army. The medical service was almost as bad.
I have seen much of the hospital work at Kirk
Kilisse after the armistice; and it has been
deplorable to see the fine fellows whose lives were
sacrificed, or whose limbs were sacrificed, through
neglect of medical knowledge. I am sure the
Bulgarians would have saved many hundreds of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
lives if there had been anything like a proper
medical service at the front.</p>

<p>At Chatalja the chief reason given for the
stoppage of operations was the ravages of disease
in the Bulgarian lines. The illness was of a
choleraic type; it had, as usual, a profound
moral as well as physical effect. The courage
of the men broke down before this visitation.
The victims howled with pain and terror, though
the same men would withstand serious wounds
without a complaint or a wincing.</p>

<p class="p2b">The Turks are blamed for the outbreak in the
Bulgarian lines. It is more than probable that
their villages, inexpressibly filthy; the prisoners
taken from their ranks; the infection of the soil
abandoned by them, were contributing <a id="causes"></a>causes.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 343px;">
<img src="images/img_201.jpg" width="343" height="500" alt="a bagpiper" />
<span class="caption">A BAGPIPER</span>
</div>

<p class="p2">But it must be stated frankly that the almost
complete absence of any sanitary discipline or
precaution in the Bulgarian lines at this place
earned for them all the diseases that afflict mankind.
So far as I can ascertain after careful
investigation, there were no sanitary police; no
attempts to secure and safeguard a pure water
supply; no latrine regulations. I have seen the
Bulgarian soldiers drinking from streams running
through battle-fields, though a few feet away were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
swollen carcases. I have seen no attempt in
the field at a proper latrine service. Some
hundreds of thousands of peasant soldiers,
accustomed to the simplest life on their own
farms, were collected together and left practically
without sanitary discipline. The details can be
filled in without my setting them forth in print.
There is one fact, however, to be recorded of
a pleasant character. In all investigations of
the hospital services I never found a case of any
malady arising from vice. There was also a
complete absence of drunkenness. This might
be ascribed to the want of means to obtain
alcohol. But in Turkey there was an abundance
of wines and spirits, and some beer in the
captured villages and towns; it led, however,
to no orgies.</p>

<p>Naturally, the Bulgarian peasant is wonderfully
healthy. His food is rough whole-meal
bread and cheese; his occasional luxuries, a
dish of the sour milk which is so well known in
London, a little alcohol on Sunday, some sweet
stuff, and, rarely, grilled meat or meat soup with
vegetables. It is possible to judge that his
alimentary tract differs widely from that of the
Western European. I should say he was almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
immune from enteric, unless attacked by a very
virulent infection. He can live on bread and
water alone without serious inconvenience for
lengthy periods. His blood is very pure, and
ordinarily heals in a way that astonished the
British surgeons.</p>

<p>Here, then, was the best of material from an
army medical point of view. Given the roughest
food, the simplest sanitary precautions, and
ordinarily good field dressing, and the army
would have marched without disease and the
wounded would have dropped out of the firing
line for a few days only. But there were no
sanitary precautions; hence disease. The hospital
service as regards the first aid in the
field was pitiably deficient; hence serious and
unnecessary losses of wounded. Without seeking
to pile up a record of horrors, I cite a few individual
instances to illustrate bad methods. At the
front, punctured bayonet wounds were closely
bandaged&mdash;in some cases stitched up&mdash;without
provision for irrigation, without even proper
cleansing. This led to gangrene and often caused
the sacrifice of a life or of a limb (which, to these
peasants, was almost as great a loss as that of
life: their feeling against amputations was very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
strong, and if they understood that amputation
was intended, they sometimes begged to be
"killed instead"). Bullet wounds also were
often plugged up on the field. When proper
treatment was at last available, it was sometimes
too late to avoid death or amputation. No
treatment at all on the field would have been
preferable to this well-intentioned but shocking
ignorance.</p>

<p>Of the purely Bulgarian hospitals those at
Kirk Kilisse are very deficient: at Philippopolis,
however, there were excellent Bulgarian hospitals,
and also at Sofia. The Russian hospital at Kirk
Kilisse is very good. The British Red Cross
Hospital, under Major E. T. F. Birrell, of the
R.A.M.C., is excellently organised, has the fullest
possible equipment, and tries to specialise in
serious cases. It is subjected locally (as is the
Russian hospital) to the criticism that by insisting
on perfection of system it unduly restricts its
salvage work: that, in short, it could deal with
far more patients if it consented to more "rough-and-ready"
methods. I record this criticism,
and acknowledge that it is based on facts. Yet
it may be urged on the other side that it was
ultimately far more useful to have a model<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
hospital to show how things should be done than
to sacrifice that valuable lesson for the sake of
striving to cope in rough-and-ready fashion with
the flood of wounded. This hospital gives interesting
proof that Great Britain is an Empire, not
an island nation. I first encountered three of
its doctors in a café. One was from the Mother
Country, one from the West Indies, one an
Australian friend, who set at once to talking of
gum trees and of Melbourne University. Then
a non-commissioned officer attached to the
hospital&mdash;most of its Staff are army men&mdash;is a
Canadian, who had had war experience in South
Africa. His comments on the Bulgarian wounded
are full of sympathy. "These chaps," he said,
"take their gruel better even than the Tommies.
The Tommy takes his all right, but he 'grouses'
about it. These chaps never grumble. One of
them had to have a very painful dressing. He
winced a little. A comrade at once laughed
at him. 'Ah,' he said, 'you learn new kinds of
dancing here.'" Nurses endorse this evidence
about the Bulgarian soldiers' patience, though
one stated that she found the officers sometimes
to be rather neurasthenic.</p>

<p>On the whole, the Bulgarian army is not strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
on science. In spade work it was not good. I
saw no perfect trenches&mdash;never a drained trench.
Undrained trenches caused some increase of
mortality and of sickness. It is uncomfortable
to stay for days, or even hours, in a trench which
the rain has partly filled with water. In no case
that I saw were there trenches with overhead
protection against howitzer fire. Except at the
Chatalja lines and around Adrianople the trenches
were, of course, intended to be of a very temporary
use, and would naturally not be elaborate. Gun-pits
and emplacements were usually fairly good.
It was the custom to dig a pit, or to put up a little
sod wall for the gun-limber (most of the artillery
work was from concealed and prepared positions).
At Chatalja the trenches were masked with the
stalks of the Turkish tobacco plants&mdash;about the
only instance I saw of masking. It was rare to
see a trench zigzagged as a precaution against
enfilading fire. The Turkish trenches I saw were
hopelessly bad.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sofia</span>, <i>December 6, 1912</i>.&mdash;Sofia, in spite of
the great victories which have been won, is
neither joyous nor contented. The failure of
the siege of Adrianople seems to rest heavy upon
the people: and there are gloomy stories of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
extent of the losses of the nation's manhood.
So far no lists of killed and wounded have been
published. "The Mass at St. Sofia," which was
the battle-cry of the first days of the war, is clearly
not a possibility now. Some mystery attaches
to the movements of the king. It is said that
he had made a vow that he would not return
to Sofia until a victorious peace was signed. The
embittered relations with the Greeks, the signs
of disagreement with the Serbians, suggest gloomy
possibilities of future troubles.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Belgrade</span>, <i>December 8, 1912</i>.&mdash;With the exception
of the army before Adrianople, the Serbians
have finished their share of the war with Turkey.
Belgrade is satisfied, but not over-elated.
Across the Danube, a broad gloomy waste of
dun waters under the winter mists, a division
of the Austrian army is mobilised. There is a
fear, almost an expectation, that Austria will
make war. But there seems neither panic nor
war-fever in the city.</p>

<p>Business is creeping back to the normal state.
At the Ministry for War there are to be seen
pathetic scenes as parents and other relatives
seek tidings of the soldiers. An old father, himself
a captain of reserves, hears that his only son, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
lieutenant, has been killed, and bursts into tears
and tells to all around his sorrow. But generally
tragic news is received stoically. Amid the congratulations
on the results of the Allies' efforts
there is an under-current of resolution to make a
better bargain with Bulgaria than the <i>ante bellum</i>
partition treaty proposed. Reports of envious and
rude treatment of the Serbian army before Adrianople
are current in the street: and there is some
talk of recalling the men. This is the irresponsible
talk of men in the street only: the authorities
are very correct in their attitude towards "our
friend and ally," and express themselves as confident
that Bulgaria of her own volition will suggest
better terms for her partner in the war.</p>

<p>A Serbian politician, who patiently endures
my bad French or makes a brave effort to talk
in English, a tongue which he is learning to speak
and can read quite well, politely excuses the
English for being such bad linguists. "For you
English who have all the poetry, all the romance,
all the science, all the philosophy a man may
want in your own language, it is not necessary to
learn any other. For us in the Balkans, we must
learn other languages or remain ignorant of much
that goes on in the world."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
In truth the Balkan peoples are astonishing
linguists. It is not at all a rare thing to find
that a man can speak Bulgarian, Serbian, Greek,
Turkish, and French. Often he adds either English
or German to this list. Bulgarian and Serbian,
of course, are but differing dialects of Russian&mdash;a
Russian can make himself understood in both
tongues though he knows only Russian. But
the grammar of one differs from that of the
other, and many of the words are different. The
Balkan people who know Turkish know it usually
in its colloquial and spoken form and not the
literary language, which is very difficult to understand
thoroughly because it is really a blending
of three languages.</p>

<h4>THE PICTURESQUE BALKANS</h4>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">It</span> is difficult to dissociate the Balkans with
bloodshed and disorder. Insensibly the mind
is tempted at every turn to direct attention to
the last battle or the future campaign which
can be seen threatening. But if the storm-racked
peninsula could be granted a term of
peaceful development, there is no doubt at all
but that it would be much favoured by voyagers
seeking picturesque beauty and wishing to go
over the fields which have been the scenes of
some of the greatest events in history. Mountain
resorts to rival those of Switzerland, spas to match
those of Germany and Austria, autumn and
winter seaside beaches of great beauty and fine
sunny climate&mdash;all these exist in the Balkan
Peninsula, and need only to be known, and to be
known as peaceful, to attract tourists.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
The Adriatic coast has charms of rugged
coast-lines and bright waters; the Black Sea
littoral, though flat and sandy, has a warm sunny
summer or autumn climate; the Aegean is a sea
of brilliant purples and rosy mists, in which air,
rock, and water mingle to greet the eye with a
great opal jewel. A November sunset on the
Sea of Marmora gave to my eyes such a feast of
suffused colour as I had not seen since I left the
shores of the southern Pacific. The rocky hills
had the rich red of the Jersey cliffs, but the sea
and sky were incomparably warmer and deeper
in tone. Across the sea the shores of distant
Asia shone dimly through two veils of mist, one
of the tenderest rose, the other of the palest gold.
The greater part of the Greek coast has the same
deliciousness of colour in autumn and in summer.</p>

<p>A few travellers bolder than the ordinary
search out nowadays the shores of the Adriatic,
the beautiful coast of Greece, and even the margin
of the Sea of Marmora in quest of beauty and
relief from the tedium of civilisation. But they
must face poor means of communication (though
to Constantinople and to Trieste there is an
excellent train service) and scanty accommodation
of any kind&mdash;almost none of good quality.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
Within a very few years, if the Balkans could
settle down to peace and the legalised plunder
of foreign visitors&mdash;a pursuit which is as profitable
as brigandage and far more comfortable,&mdash;the
seaside resorts that would spring up within
Balkan territories would of themselves provide
a handsome revenue. The shores of the Aegean
and of the Sea of Marmora in particular would
attract tourists wearied of the air of hackneyed
sameness which comes after a while to pervade
seaside haunts in Italy and France.</p>

<p>From another attraction the Balkan States
could hope for a great tourist traffic. I have
caught but fleeting glimpses of the Balkan range
and of the Rhodopes and the Serbian mountains,
but have seen enough to know that they offer
boundless delights to the climber, to the seeker
after winter sports, and to the lover of the
picturesque; and the Swiss Alps in these days are
overcrowded, and the Tyrolean mountains and
the Carpathians begin to receive a big overflow
of people who have a taste for heights that are
not covered with hotels and funicular railways.
But the mountains of the Balkan Peninsula
offer prospects, I believe, of greater beauty,
certainly of greater wildness, than any other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
ranges of Europe. Of the Rhodope mountains,
in particular, one gets the most alluring accounts
from the rare travellers who have explored them.
Seen by the passing voyager as they stand guard
with their farthest spurs over Philippopolis, they
suggest that no account of their charm could be
too glowing. I have promised myself one autumn
or summer a month in this range, exploring its
flower-filled valleys and its wild cliffs, shining
through an air which seems now of rose and now
of violet.</p>

<p>For winter sports the Serbian, Montenegrin,
and Albanian mountains, as well as the chief
Balkan range, promise well. I believe that it
was part of the plan of Bulgarian reorganisation
after the war, which King Ferdinand had in his
mind, to set up great winter hotels in the mountains
of his kingdom. The other Balkan States could
with advantage give hospitality to similar plans.
Provided that security is assured&mdash;and the Balkan
peasant is in my experience the gentlest-mannered
kind who ever cut throats in a wholesale way
at the call of a mischief-maker&mdash;visitors to the
mountains of the Balkan Peninsula would find
the wildness, the uncouthness of the surrounding
national life, very attractive. The picturesque<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
national costumes, the national music, wild and
uncanny, the strange national dances, all add to
the fascination of the savage scenery. In an
age when a fog of dreary sameness comes over all
the civilised world, the Balkans have a great
asset in their primitivism. Theirs is not a wholly
European civilisation; indeed, except in the
capital cities, it is not chiefly a European civilisation.
Everywhere there is a touch of the mystery,
the fatalism, the desert-bred wildness of the
Asiatic steppes. For centuries the hand of the
Turk has been heavy on the land, and a strong
stream of his blood courses still through the veins
of most of the Balkan peoples. It is not the
East this Balkan Peninsula, but it is not the
West, nor will be for some generations.</p>

<p>There is yet another possible means of attracting
great streams of visitors to the Balkan regions.
Throughout the mountains there are numberless
medicinal springs. In Serbia and Bulgaria the
water of two springs is being exploited for table
use, and in Bulgaria the warm medicinal springs
are being developed for bathing resorts. At
Sofia there are now in course of erection great
public baths which will be equal to any in Europe
when they are completed. In the mountains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
above Sofia warm springs are being utilised, and
quite a large spa village has grown up. King
Ferdinand, who has a fine commercial instinct
whatever the failures of his war diplomacy, has
done good service to his kingdom by developing
its baths and springs.</p>

<p>The plain country of the Balkan Peninsula
is but little attractive. Under the Turkish rule
nearly all plantations of trees were destroyed,
and a general air of desolation was maintained.
Since the Turk left, cultivation and development
have been on strictly utilitarian lines, and there
has been little chance for gardens or woods. The
eye of the voyager misses them, and misses also
the sight of castles, churches, or great buildings.
The dreariness of the plain is unrelieved by
forests. The rivers flow sullenly along without a
bordering of trees. The Thracian plain&mdash;the
greater part of which has now gone back to
Turkey and thus lost hope of a redemption of its
really fertile soil&mdash;is in particular desolate and
forbidding. But even there, and more frequently
in the plain country of Bulgaria and Serbia, there
is now and again a charming village in some
dell with adornment of trees and gardens. The
average village, however, is a collection of hovels,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
their roofs lying so close to the ground that they
seem to be rather burrows than huts, their aspect
suggesting that they are hiding themselves and
their inhabitants from the eye of a possible
ravager.</p>

<p>Desolate as this plain country is, it has its
attractions at dawn and sunset in the clear colourfull
air of the Balkan Peninsula; and where the
hill slopes, denuded of their forests, have been
covered over by a dense oak scrub the autumn
aspect of the plain at sunset is incomparably
lovely. The scrub, when the first of the autumn
frosts come, blazes out in such scarlet and gold
as cannot be imagined in the moist and soft
climate of England. With the setting of the sun
and the coming of the violet night the earth's
carpet seems to be here smouldering, there burning,
a sea of lambent fire so bright that you look to
see its burgeoning reflected in the sky.</p>

<p>I should advise the tourist wishing to see the
Balkan Peninsula at its best to choose the fall
of the year for a visit. In the summer there is
great heat and dust and plague of flies. In the
winter travel is impossible with any comfort
except along the railway lines, and the whole
Peninsula is frost-bound. The spring is a beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
season at its later end, but not at the time of the
thaw.</p>

<p class="p2b">As to the route for a voyage there are several
alternatives. One may take the Oriental Express
through to Constantinople and work a way up the
Balkan Peninsula from there: or take train to
Trieste and approach the Balkans by the Adriatic
side: or, taking the Oriental Express, leave it at
Bucharest and journey from there to Sofia: or,
taking the Oriental Express, leave it at Belgrade,
making that the starting-point for a riding trip.
Certainly to enjoy the country one must leave
the railways and journey on horseback or by
cart over the wilder tracks. An interpreter who
speaks English can be engaged in any one of the
capitals. The hire of horses, oxen, and carts is
very cheap, if you are properly advised by your
interpreter and pay the local rates only. Forage,
too, is cheap: and so is "the food of the country,"
i.e. bread, cheese, bacon, and goat and sheep
flesh. Most civilised luxuries of food can be
obtained in the capitals and bigger towns, but
they are <a id="dear"></a>dear.</p>

<p class="p2">Let me suggest a few typical Balkan tours.</p>

<p>Take train to Belgrade: then go by Danube
steamer to Widdin. From Widdin to Sofia go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
by rail, and then back to Belgrade on horseback,
sending on heavy luggage by rail, but making at
Nish on the way a depot of provisions and linen.</p>

<p>Take train to Bucharest. Go from there
to Stara Zagora on horseback, crossing the
Roumanian frontier at Roustchouk, going over
the trail of the Russian Army of Liberation and
seeing the Balkan mountain passes.</p>

<p>Take train to Sofia, and from there to Yamboli.
At Yamboli go on horseback (in the track of the
Bulgarian Third Army of 1912) to Kirk Kilisse,
Lule Burgas, Chorlu, Silivri (on the Sea of
Marmora), and Constantinople. A somewhat wild
trip this would be, but quite practicable. The
most comfortable way to travel would be to
take ox wagons for the luggage and the camping
outfit. That would restrict the day's march to
twenty miles. The horses&mdash;(diverging to look
at scenery and battle-fields)&mdash;would do about
thirty miles a day.</p>

<p>Take train to Constantinople, and from there
boat to Salonica. Go on horseback from Salonica
to Belgrade. This would show the most disturbed
part of the Balkan Peninsula and some of its
wildest scenery.</p>

<p>Take train to Philippopolis, and from there go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
on horseback and with ox wagons for a tour of
the Rhodope mountains.</p>

<p>Of course it is possible to take much tamer
tours of the Balkans. Practically all the big towns
are connected with the European railway systems.
But you would see, thus, towns and not the
country. The Balkan towns are to my eye very
dreary. There are practically no fine old buildings,
for in the Turkish occupation the greater
number of these were destroyed. The modern
buildings have rarely any character. The
churches, usually of the Slav school of architecture,
alone relieve the monotony of economical imitations
of French and British buildings. In
Belgrade, it is true, there has been an effort to
carry the Slav note farther, and some of the
commercial and public buildings show a Moscow
influence.</p>

<p>Mr. Noel Buxton, M.P., that most enthusiastic
admirer of the Bulgarians, can carry his enthusiasm
so far as to admire Sofia. He wrote recently
(<i>With the Bulgarian Staff</i>):</p>

<blockquote><p>Few sights can be more inspiring to the lover of
liberty and national progress than a view of Sofia from
the hill where the great seminary of the national church
overlooks the plain. There at your feet is spread out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
the unpretentious seat of a government which stands
for the advance of European order in lands long blighted
with barbarism. Here resides, and is centred, the virile
force of a people which has advanced the bounds of
liberty. From here, symbolised by the rivers and roads
running down on each side, has extended, and will
further extend, the power of modern education, of
unhampered ideas, of science, and of humanity. From
this magnificent view-point Sofia stretches along the
low hill with the dark background of the Balkan beyond.
Against that background now stands out the new
embodiment of Bulgarian and Slavonic energy, genius,
and freedom of mind, the great cathedral, with its vast
golden domes brilliantly standing out from the shade
behind them. In no other capital is a great church
shown to such effect, viewed from one range of hills
against the mountainous slopes of another. It is a
building which, with its marvellous mural paintings,
would in any capital form an object of world interest,
but which, in the capital of a tiny peasant State,
supremely embodies that breadth of mind which</p>

<p><span style="margin-left:6em">... rejects the lore</span><br />
<span style="margin-left:4em">Of nicely calculated less or more.</span>
</p></blockquote>

<p>But I think that that is a too kindly view.
What makes the Balkan capitals additionally
dreary is that there is no "society" in the
European sense. The Turkish idea of keeping
the womenfolk in the harem survives to the
extent that woman is not supposed to frequent
places of entertainment, to receive or to pay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
visits. In Bulgaria the women are secluded
with an almost Turkish strictness: in Serbia,
not quite so strictly, but still strictly.</p>

<p>Bucharest is quite another story; but Bucharest
would rather resent being called a Balkan city.
There is no seclusion of the very charming
Roumanian women, and the atmosphere of the
city is a little more than gay. Plant a section
of Paris, a section including Montmartre, into
the middle of an enlargement of the old quarter of
Belgrade, and that is Bucharest. It is the one
Balkan city which has a luxurious and to an
extent polished aristocracy.</p>

<p>Some of the smaller towns are slightly more interesting&mdash;Philippopolis,
for instance, in a position of great natural
beauty&mdash;but the average Balkan town must be set down as squalid.
Its centres of social interest are the cafés, where men who have the
leisure assemble to drink coffee made in the Turkish fashion, tea made
in the Russian fashion, and occasionally <i>vodka</i>, which is the usual
alcoholic stimulant. Tobacco is smoked mostly in the form of cigarettes.
Excellent (and cheap) cigarettes are supplied by the government <i>Régies</i>
in Serbia and Bulgaria.</p>

<p class="p2">The wise tourist will keep clear of the Balkan
towns apart from the actual capitals, and will
carry his food and lodging with him. Under
these circumstances a good standard of ease
can be maintained if a train of ox wagons
sufficient to the size of the party is enlisted.
Ladies can travel with fair comfort in an ox
wagon. As regards the danger of Balkan travel,
in my experience&mdash;and that was during war-time&mdash;there
is none. Serbian peasant, Bulgarian
peasant, Greek peasant, Turkish peasant, alike
are amiable and obliging fellows, if they do not
feel in duty bound to cut your throat on some
theological or political point. Being strangers,
tourists would have no theology and no politics.
So much for the inhabitants. The officials,
provided passports are clear and the precaution
is taken of getting letters at the capital from the
authorities of the country you are travelling
through, will be helpful. The one district that
might be a little dangerous is that corner of
Macedonia where Greek and Bulgar are always
playing against one another the old game of
massacre.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h4>THE BALKAN PEOPLES IN ART AND INDUSTRY</h4>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The</span> five centuries of Turkish domination, during
which all the arts and most of the crafts were
neglected in the Balkan Peninsula, killed nearly
completely the ancient civilisations of the Greeks,
the Serbs, and the Bulgars. But a few traces of
the old culture survive to this day as mournful
and tattered relics of the greatness of those
departed Empires. The old Bulgarian Empire,
combining a Slav with a Turconian element;
the old Serbian Empire, almost purely Slav but
influenced a little by Italian and Grecian influence,
evolved in the days of its greatness the beginnings
of a national literature and national architecture.
In Serbia particularly was there a strong
and promising growth of humane culture, and the
greatest of the Serbian rulers, Stephen Dushan
(14th century), whose death before the walls of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
Constantinople at the beginning of the Turkish
invasions gave up the Balkan Peninsula to the
Crescent, left as one monument to his name a
well-reasoned code of laws. He was throughout
his reign a sincere friend of learning. In Bulgaria
during the 10th century, under the Czar Simeon,
there was a brief efflorescence of learning.
Montenegro, which alone of the Balkan States
kept its head unbowed before the Turk, was a
busy centre of literary effort in the 16th century.
Under the stress of constant war, however, the
arts of peace died down almost completely in the
Balkans until the Liberation of the peoples in
the 19th century. During the interval, however,
the peasants in their homes kept up some little
knowledge of the traditions of their forefathers'
greatness. Legends were passed down from father
to son in chants set to a rough music. In these
chants, too, were recorded the deeds of heroism
which marked the ever-recurring revolts against
the Turk.</p>

<p>What survives to-day from this period of
oppression is a very characteristic national music,
melancholy usually, as might be expected, but of
arresting sweetness; and an art of peasant-applied
decoration, which recalls the earlier and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
more primitive forms of Byzantine Art. Balkan
tapestries, Balkan carpets, Balkan embroideries,
woven or stitched by the peasant women, have
a note of barbaric boldness in design and colour
which distinguishes them at once from the
peasant work of other countries.</p>

<p>This applied art in decoration is wisely
fostered by the various governments, and there is
liberal encouragement also given to modern art.
Especially is this the case in Bulgaria. The
impression I have got from seeing picture collections
in the Balkans is that the local artists have
learned foreign methods without adding any
national bent of their own, and contrive to give
a native character to their pictures only when
they make the choice of some particularly horrible
subject. Yet there should come a vigorous art
as well as a vigorous literature one day from
these Balkan States. There the mysticism, the
melancholy, the transcendentalism of the Slav
is mixed with the fatalism of the Turk, and the
vivacity of the Greek and the Roumanian in the
national types. Byzantine traditions, Slav traditions,
classic Greek traditions, Roman traditions
mingle to influence this composite character,
the two former predominating, but the two latter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
having a very definite power. It should be rich
soil for talent, even for genius.</p>

<p>Interesting opportunities were given in the
Southern Slav Art Exhibitions of 1904 and 1906
(the first at Belgrade, the second at Sofia) to note
the trend of art in the Balkans. At those
Exhibitions Bulgarian, Serbian, Croatian, and
Slavonian arts were represented. The Croatian
pictures&mdash;I follow a trustworthy guide in stating
this&mdash;showed a high degree of technical skill, not
distinguishable from Austrian art in character:
the Slavonian pictures were also technically
good, but of a more impressionist character:
the Serbian pictures imitated in technique the
Old Masters, but took their subjects almost
exclusively from Serbian history: the Bulgarian
pictures had no national characteristic in style,
but usually sought to be transcriptions of some
form of Bulgarian life of the day.</p>

<p>Summing up the art position in the Balkans,
it can be fairly said that before the outbreak of
the last great war very good progress had been
made for the few years since the Liberation from
the Turks. A wise policy for the future would be
to encourage as much as possible the peasant arts
and crafts which are distinctive, and not to seek
to impose too much of modern art education,
which may stifle national influences and inflict a
sterile sameness.</p>
<p class="p2b"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 402px;">
<img src="images/img_235.jpg" width="402" height="500" alt="a Bulgarian farm" />
<span class="caption">A BULGARIAN FARM</span>
</div>
<p class="p2">Balkan industry varies greatly with the height
of the country, as well as with the racial type.
The mountaineers are usually lacking in steady
industry: the peoples of the plain are usually exceptionally
hard workers. Very many emigrants
from the Balkans go to the United States to work
there in the mines, and on works of railway construction,
for a term of years. The Bulgarian will
come back from the United States with £300 saved
up, and settle down in his native village as farmer
or trader. The Serbian will come back with £200
saved up, but with a wider knowledge of United
States life, and he will settle down as pastoralist or
farmer, but not as trader. The Albanian or Montenegrin
will come back with little or no money,
but with a wonderful armoury of silver-adorned
weapons and much other personal decoration.
So graced, the mountaineer will have no difficulty
in marrying the girl of his choice, and she will
do most of the work that is needed thereafter,
whilst he attends to the hunting and the fighting.
The Greek and the Roumanian go abroad,
preferably as traders, and afterwards elect to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
stay abroad, though it is to be recorded in proof
of modern Greek patriotism that in 1912 there
was a steady flow of Greeks from all parts of
the world coming back to their native land to
fight in the army.</p>

<p>Considered industrially the Bulgarian is the
best type in the Balkans. He is a steady, tireless
worker on the soil; takes to factory life amiably;
and has in a very strongly marked degree "the
road-making talent."</p>

<p>A very valuable index to national character is
provided by a people's roads. The most successful
Imperial governors, the Romans, were also
builders of the finest roads the world has known.
The British people have been good road-builders
as well as good Empire-makers; the French
people, too, and every other people who at any
time have done big enduring work in the government
of the world. If a nation is not a good
road-building nation it will not go far: and the
converse is probably true. On this road-building
test the Bulgarians have a prosperous future
indicated, for they are very pertinacious and
skilful road-builders. During the 1912 war I
noticed that despite all other pre-occupations they
were pushing roads forward at every possible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
opportunity. The Turks going back to Adrianople
and Kirk Kilisse found a great number of roads
built or building&mdash;the first serious efforts in that
direction since the downfall of the Roman
Empire.</p>

<p>The Bulgarian's chief occupation is agriculture.
The system of land tenures is that of peasant
ownership. There are no large estates and
very few non-occupying landlords. The chief
crops are wheat, barley, maize, rice (around
Philippopolis), tobacco, and roses. The tobacco
is of as good quality, almost, as that of Turkey.
The Bulgarian Government encourages the culture
of tobacco by distributing seed, free of cost,
among the planters, by setting a bounty on the
export tariff, and by authorising the Bulgarian
National Bank to consent to loans on the surety
of certificates granted to the planters until they
are able to dispose of their crops advantageously.</p>

<p>Tobacco culture is carried on chiefly in the
south and in the provinces of Silistria and
Kustendil. The area of the plantations is
estimated at 3000 hectares. The province of
Haskovo has the greatest yield; then follows
Philippopolis, with 300,000 kilograms; Kustendil
and Silistria, 210,000 kilograms. According to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
approximate calculations based on various
statistics, three-fourths of the tobacco crop of
Bulgaria is consumed by the inhabitants and
only a quarter is exported.</p>

<p>The rose crop is next in importance after
tobacco. The roses are used exclusively for the
distilling of attar of roses. The rose gardens
are limited to 148 parishes of the provinces of
Philippopolis and Stara Zagora, and occupy a
total area of 5094 hectares. The quantity and
quality of the attar depend very much on the
weather at the time of bloom and gathering.
The roses most cultivated in Bulgaria are the red
rose (<i>Rosa damascena</i>) and the white rose (<i>Rosa
alba</i>). The best gardens are at Kazanlik, Karlovo,
Klissoura, and Stara Zagora. The distilling of
the attar is now a Government monopoly. The
cultivation of beetroot has been introduced
recently and is confined to the province of Sofia.
The sugar refinery near Sofia utilises the whole
crop for local consumption.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note in connection with
Balkan agriculture that as far back as 1863 the
much-abused Turk had actually adopted the
very modern idea of an agricultural <i>Credit Foncier</i>
system in the Balkans! In that year Midhat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
Pasha, Governor of the Danubian Vilayet, prepared
a scheme for the creation of banks, to
assist the rural population. The scheme having
been approved by the Turkish Government,
several of these banks were established. The
peasants were allowed to repay in kind the
loans which were advanced to them, the banks
themselves selling the agricultural products.
With the object of increasing the capital of the
banks, a special tax was introduced obliging the
farmers to hand every year to these institutions
part of their produce in kind.</p>

<p>When it was realised that these banks were
of great service to the rural population, to which
they advanced money at 12 per cent interest&mdash;instead
of 30-100 per cent, as the usurers generally
did&mdash;the Turkish Government extended the
reform to the whole Turkish Empire, and obliged
the peasants to create similar banks in all the
district centres. According to their statutes
one-third of the net profits of these banks was
destined for works of public utility, such as
bridges, roads, fountains, schools, etc., while
the remaining two-thirds went to increase the
capital of the banks.</p>

<p>During the Russo-Turkish war several of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
these banks lost their funds, the functionaries
of the Turkish Government having carried away
all the cash, as well as the securities and other
property belonging to the banks' clients. After
the war the debtors refused to pay, and only part
of the property of the banks was restored, by
means of the issue of new bonds. For that
unfortunate end the war is rather to be blamed
than the Turk. This <i>Credit Foncier</i> system is
pretty clear proof that the Turkish power was
not always cruel and rapacious, since so sensible
a reform was set on foot in one of the Christian
provinces under the Sublime Porte.</p>

<p>Apart from the industries of the soil, Bulgaria
has a small mining population and an increasing
factory population. The Protective tariff is used
freely to encourage young industries, and there
is an effort just now to set up cotton-spinning
as a national enterprise.</p>

<p>Serbia had a mixed pastoral and agricultural
population up to the outbreak of the war of
1912, with pig-raising as the greatest of the
national industries. By the Treaty of Bucharest
she has, however, acquired much new territory,
and is now probably predominantly an agricultural
country. She has, too, great mineral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
resources at present, but they are little developed,
and fine forests which only need an improvement
of the means of communication to be commercially
a big asset. The Serbian is not so steadily
devoted to his work as the Bulgarian: his is
the pastoral as opposed to the agricultural
character. Nevertheless he has a reasonable
faculty of industry. As is the case in Bulgaria
the bulk of the land is held by peasant proprietors.
These are organised into communes very much
on the Russian system. It is an interesting
fact that though in Serbia there is almost the
same degree as in Bulgaria of seclusion of the
women of the nation, a Serbian woman may be
the head of the village commune, and, as such,
exercise a very real authority.</p>

<p>Both in Bulgaria and Serbia the rights of the
commune are very jealously safeguarded. The
central government must take no part in the
administration of the communes, or maintain
any agents of its own to interfere with their
affairs. The commune forms the basis of the
State fabric and enjoys a complete autonomy.
It is the smallest unit in the administrative
organisation of the country. Every district is
subdivided into communes, which are either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
urban or rural. The commune is a corporation.
Every subject must belong to a commune and
figure in its registers, the laws not tolerating the
state of vagrancy. The members of the Commune
Council are elected by universal suffrage,
in the same way and subject to the same precautions
as the members of the National Assembly.
In passing it may be observed that theoretically
the governments of the Balkan States are free
democracies. Practically they are oligarchies
tempered by assassination, which is still a
favoured political weapon.</p>

<p>The Serbian has not much of the commercial
faculty: and people of other nations manage
very many of the businesses in Serbia.</p>

<p>The Montenegrin is willing to be a worker
if it does not interfere with his manly amusements
of warfare. His occupations are pastoral
and agricultural pursuits and the chase. The
Albanian is not content to be a worker at all under
any conditions. His occupations are dancing and
swaggering whilst his womenfolk carry on the
bulk of the primitive pastoral and agricultural
work.</p>

<p class="p2b">It is not possible to hope for much industrial
or commercial progress in Albania. But in Serbia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
and Bulgaria there are rich opportunities for
enterprise and capital provided that an era of
peace could be reckoned upon. It is the uncertainty
on that point that will stand in the
way of future Balkan development. When after
the Treaty of London the Balkan League fell to
pieces there was incurred, in addition to other
sacrifices, a serious loss of confidence on the part
of European capital.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h4>THE FUTURE OF THE BALKANS</h4>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">We</span> have seen that a blood-mist has hung over
the Balkans during all the centuries that history
knows. Nature set up there lists for the great
contests of races&mdash;on the path from the cold north
of Europe to the warm south; on the path from
Asia to Europe; and each great campaign left
behind it shreds of devastated peoples. These
shreds of peoples dwelling in the Balkans to-day
have a blood-thirst as an inescapable heritage.
Turk, Bulgar, Serb, Roumanian, Greek&mdash;they
may hold the peace for a time, and some may
try to think that they are friends with others;
but all have something of hate or fear or contempt
for the others, and all prepare in peace
for the next fight.</p>

<p class="p2b">The Fates making the Balkan Peninsula the
battle-ground of empires and races, the field of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
last stands, the refuge of residual fragments of
peoples, imposed upon it its bloody tradition.
Under other conditions, Serb or Bulgar or Greek
or Turk or Roumanian left to themselves might
have made happier history. For all these races
can be human, reasonable, companionable. I
have seen something of all of them in following
a Balkan campaign as a war correspondent (not
following always as the sheltered guest of an
army, but forcing a solitary path through the
peasant population), and in watching the wonderful
acrobatic lying of a Balkan Peace Conference
have seen thus the best and the worst of them.
I have been an unofficial member of a Bulgarian
court-martial; the guest of a dozen and more
Bulgarian and Serbian army outposts, dependent
often for food and shelter on the kindness of
peasant soldiers; for days have held at the mercy
of Balkan peasants my life and my property;
have been mistaken for a wandering Turk twice,
and have never suffered violence, rudeness, or
the loss of a pennyworth. For the peasants,
the commonfolk of all the Balkan peoples, I
have come thus to a hearty liking; their priests
and politicians (with a few exceptions), a different
feeling. Knowing that the massacre is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
national sport in many districts of the Balkans;
that at the outbreak of the 1912 war the death-rate
by violence actually decreased in some
quarters because the killing was systematised a
little and put under a sort of regulation; that
always Turks and Exarchate Christians and
Patriarchate Christians are plotting against one
another new raids and murders, still I maintain
that, if left to themselves, if freed from the
prompting of priests and politicians the Balkan
peasants of any race are quite decent folk.
So I wish heartily that there was fair reason to
hope for peace and happiness for them. Is there
fair reason? To that question a study of the races
and the personalities can give clues for an <a id="answer"></a>answer.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/img_247.jpg" width="600" height="427" alt="Albanian tribesmen" />
<p class="ralign"><span class="caption"><i>Underwood &amp; Underwood</i></span>
</p>

<p class="centerb">ALBANIAN TRIBESMEN</p>
</div>

<p class="p2">The Bulgarian is dour, dull, a little greedy,
honest, very industrious. He is almost as much
a Turk as a Slav. (I was told that during the
Turkish occupation a Bulgarian mother finding
herself with child after violence by a Turk
brought up the child with her family, whilst a
Serbian mother under the same circumstances
killed the infant at birth.) The Bulgarian is
very moral, marrying at an early age.</p>

<p>The Bulgarian peasant soldiers were very
honest and loyal. At Mustapha Pasha one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
night, being short of food, I tried to get bread
at the military bakery (all bread and flour having
been requisitioned for the army). I offered a
soldier up to five francs for a loaf without tempting
him to sell it. Finally I had to get bread as a
charity by declaring that I was actually in want
of it for food. Later, travelling between Silivri
and Chatalja, I encountered four Bulgarian foot
soldiers who had become separated from their
regiment and were starving. They asked for
food and I gave them all I could spare, enough
for two meals. One of the men produced a
purse and took out some coppers wishing to pay.</p>

<p>Travelling across Thrace (then in Bulgarian
occupation), I often put up at some military
post, being invited to become a member of the
little mess&mdash;usually an official or two and four
or five non-commissioned officers. Nearly always
I had the same experience, that I was made free
of the stewed goat and rice, or the dish of eggs
and flour, or the bread and cheese of the Bulgarians,
and when I wished to add from my stores chocolate
and biscuits and dates, just a scrap or two would
be taken. I could see the men's eyes hungering
for the delicacies, but nothing would induce them
to take anything material from my stores.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>The Bulgarian peasant soldier and officer I
found, in short, to be a gentleman. Yet nationally
Bulgaria is not "a gentleman," and has come
to its present sorry state, I believe, largely on
that account. The old Bulgarian aristocracy
was exterminated by the Turks. The surviving
Bulgarian peasantry has not yet been able to
produce another aristocracy. It is the more
cunning rather than the more worthy son of the
peasant who wins to a sort of an education&mdash;often
abroad&mdash;and becomes the lawyer, politician,
official. In very many cases he carries with him
into a higher stratum of society few of his peasant
virtues and all of his peasant faults. He gets
an overweening pride in his own acuteness. He
becomes arrogant, "too-clever-by-half," and
intrigue teaches him cruelty. I can contrast
vividly two Bulgarian types in a noted diplomat,
who fancied himself a Bismarck and had about
the wits of an office boy, and an old peasant
captain with whom I travelled from Kirk Kilisse
to Chorlu. Generalising, the "leading men" in
Bulgaria are of a poor type (there are exceptions),
the leading priests of a still poorer type;
the people themselves are a sound people, and
when the ambitious among them contrive to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
preserve their peasant virtues through the
ordeal of education they will become a great
people.</p>

<p>The Bulgarian did not seem to me naturally
cruel. All the time that I was with the main
army I saw no trace of outrage or cruelty. I
did see several instances of curt and merciful
justice.</p>

<p>I arrived one night at the Tchundra River
alone, having gone forward from my ox cart because
the miserable Macedonian driver and the still
more miserable Bulgarian servant I had (I suspect
he was in training for the diplomatic service)
could not be induced to do a fair day's march.
A vedette outpost of five men held the bridge.
They took me&mdash;as I judged from their gestures
rather than from their language, of which I
understood only one word, "Turc"&mdash;for a Turk.
But they let me stay unmolested at their camp
fire for an hour until an officer who spoke French
appeared. I could give several similar instances.
Never did I feel nervous in the least when making
my way alone through the country in Bulgarian
occupation (most of the time I was alone, for
after a while I dropped my Macedonian and my
Bulgarian servant).</p>

The Turk I found disappointing. I had

harem, a stable of Arab steeds, and a fierce and
warlike manner. I found the Turk to be rather
a shabby individual; monogamous usually (but
with the free and easy ideas as to his rights over
Christian women which are almost consequent
upon his philosophy of life, and cause most of
the trouble when the Turk lives by the side of a
Christian population); much addicted to sweetmeats&mdash;his
shops were full of Scotch lollies and
English biscuits. Certainly most of the Turks
I have encountered were prisoners or dwelling
in conquered country. But, making all allowance
for that, the traditional fiery Turk of martial
fame no longer exists, I should say, in European
Turkey. The Turkish prisoners in the hands of
the Bulgarians seemed to be glad to have arrived
at a fate which meant regular food. In old
Bulgaria I found Turks living quite contentedly
under Christian rule, and in many cases following
menial occupations. The boot-blacks
in the streets were Turks, the porters were
Turks.</p>

<p>I had a Turkish driver for five days once from
Kirk Kilisse to Mustapha Pasha. The first hour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
of our acquaintance he won my heart by telling
me (through an interpreter) that since his horses
had been requisitioned by the Bulgarians, he had
not been able to get proper food for them, and
he embraced his ponies, which were really in
rather good condition. I applauded the noble
Turk and his love for horses, and bought tobacco
for him which he welcomed with tears of joy,
as he had been without it for long. The horses
carried the cart a gallant thirty miles that day,
and we camped at a burned-out village. Mr.
Turk set himself to enjoy a smoke over the fire.
My own supper I prepared, and gave him some
to eke out his bread and cheese, and then told
him to water and feed the horses. Because the
well was 400 yards away and the tobacco was
sweet and the fire comforting, the Turk had
no wish to do this, but was ready to let them
go through the night without food or water. I
had to threaten to flog him (and to start to do
it) before he would attend to the horses. Yet
after that incident I slept in the cart without
a thought that the Turk would consider himself
offended and cut my throat. As a matter of
fact the touch of the whip did not rankle with
him, and at Mustapha Pasha when, the journey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
ended, I gave him a little money for himself, Mr.
Turk prostrated himself in gratitude.</p>

<p>I believe that the warlike virtues have died
out of the Turk in Europe. Of other nation-making
and nation-maintaining qualities he has
none. In all Turkey from the borders of Bulgaria
to the lines of Chatalja, I found no roads, no street
lamps, no drainage, no water supply (I was not
in Adrianople). Except for a few agricultural
peasants I found nowhere the Turk doing any
useful work. In a characteristic Turkish town
the shops were kept by Greeks, the industries
carried on by Greeks, Macedonians, and Bulgarians.
The Turk was the tax-collector, the official, the
soldier, and did none of these things well.
That acute observer of the Turkish character,
Mr. L. March Phillips, in his book <i>In the Desert</i>
upholds that the Turk is impossible as a civilising
force:</p>

<blockquote><p>Or, for a third example, come to the craggy hills of
Southern Albania, and mix, if but for half an hour, with
the armed shepherds, as wild and intractable as their
own crags, or as the gaunt dogs which guard their flocks
from the wolves, and whose attentions to strangers you
are apt to find such a nuisance. You will understand
from the first glance at the men more of the interminable
Balkan difficulty than newspapers and books can ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
teach you. These are the fellows who swoop down
from their peaks on the mixed races of the plains and
carry fire and slaughter through village and valley.
Their natural aptitude for fighting and foraging, for
bearing things with a strong hand, for cowing the weak
and feeble, for vindicating the old "might is right"
theory, is written all over them. You see it in their
gait, glance, walk, and manner, you hear it in every
accent of their voice, you feel it in their individuality
and presence.</p>

<p>These are specimens of the Moslem type, the type
that stops short at the virile virtues, that makes the best
host and worst neighbour in the world, that has many
splendid qualities to recommend it, but to which all
that makes life profound and inexhaustible is a dead
letter. It is the most strongly marked and salient type
I have ever met with. There is the Moslem walk, the
Moslem scowl, the Moslem courtesy, the Moslem dignity,
the Moslem carriage and attitudes and features, the
Moslem composure, and the Moslem fury. All these
traits and characteristics, inspired by the same temper,
expressing the same ideal, conspire to depict a figure
so notable that you must be a dull observer indeed if
you cannot pick him out from a mixed crowd as you
would pick out a Chinaman in the London streets.</p>

<p>Some people say it is the religion that creates the
type. "There," they say of Mohammedanism, "is a
religion that breeds men." It would be truer, I think,
to say that Mohammedanism recommends itself to men
at a certain stage of their development, and has for that
stage a natural affinity. Every race goes through a
time when the virile estimate of life and the splendour
of self-assertion seem the finest things possible. It is
at this time it is open to the attack of El Islam. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
Moslem religion answers all its needs at this stage, and
lays good hold of it, and having once laid hold of it, it
sanctifies the ideas belonging to this stage, and so tends
to restrict the race to it. There is no instance on record
of a people having embraced Mohammedanism and
afterwards achieving a complete, or what gives promise
of ever becoming a complete, civilisation.</p></blockquote>

<p>During my stay in the Balkans I found no
certain evidence of Turkish cruelty. There was
plenty of evidence offered by the Bulgarians,
but it usually smelt of the lamp of some patriotic
journalist of Sofia. Once near Mustapha Pasha&mdash;when
all the war correspondents were cooped up
under strict censorship, prevented from seeing
any of the operations around Adrianople&mdash;the
Bulgarians found it necessary to burn a village
for strategic reasons. The chance was offered
to the Press photographers of seeing this, if it
were represented in their pictures as the atrocious
burning of a village by the Turks. I believe
that the offer was accepted by some. The
"atrocities" by Turks, regularly recorded by
the Bulgarian Press Bureau were, as far as the
main theatre of operations was concerned, founded
on similar evidence. During its first phase I
believe that the war was very humanely conducted
on all sides. In Macedonia, of course, there were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
some deplorable atrocities, but I believe the
normal massacre conditions there were rather
bettered than otherwise by the outbreak of war.</p>

<p>To sum up the Turk, I do not think he will
survive for long in Europe. As a matter of
hard fact there really are not many real Turks
left in Europe.</p>

<p>The Serbian, with his highlander the
Montenegrin, is a far more engaging personality
than the Bulgarian. He lacks the stubborn,
dour courage of his neighbour, but he has more
<i>élan</i>. In military life the Bulgarian would
supply incomparable infantry, the Serbians be
superior in artillery and cavalry. In social life
the Serbian is convivial and hospitable. Whilst
the Bulgarian wishes to go to bed early that he
may get up early and push the road he is making
along a little farther, the Serbian will keep you
at his dinner-table drinking and singing until
far into the morning. He is not troubling about
a road.</p>

<p>When the Serbian army came to help the
Bulgarians in the siege of Adrianople, the contrast
between the two armies and the two camps was
great. The Serbian men were smarter, better
equipped, their quarters cleaner, and from their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
mess tents would come by night the sound of
revelry. One might imagine Roundheads and
Cavaliers camping side by side.</p>

<p>The Allies did not fraternise. For that I
blamed the Bulgarians. The positions in regard
to the Serbian aid at Adrianople, as I understood
it, was this: that originally the Bulgarians
engaged to help the Serbians in their campaign,
but this was found not to be necessary: that the
Bulgarians, later, asked for aid against Adrianople,
and it was promptly given without any conditions
being imposed, though there then already existed
in the Serbian mind a desire to modify the
territorial partition arrangement they had with
Bulgaria and this request for aid might have been
taken as a good opportunity for raising that
question. I believe those to be the facts, but
since in Balkan diplomacy it is always a matter
of finding out the truth of comparing and weighing
and deducing from a series of lies, I cannot state
them with absolute certainty. If they are true,
the Serbians behaved like gentlemen in not
raising against an ally an awkward question at
a time when help was asked. Quite certainly
the Bulgarian authorities behaved like boors
to their Serbian friends. Things were made as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
unpleasant as was reasonably possible for them
in all kinds of niggling ways around Adrianople.
The Serbians behaved well under great provocation.</p>

<p class="p2b">During the first sessions of the Balkan Peace
Conference I had opportunities of observing the
same good behaviour on the part of the Serbians.
Bulgarian diplomacy was, as usual, very exasperating.
It was not only that Bulgaria was
insisting on having the hide, horn, and hoofs of
Turkey, but also on rubbing salt into her bare
carcase. The Turkish delegates approached the
Serbians&mdash;whose territorial demands as far as
Turkey was concerned were satisfied, but who
had a pending controversy with the Bulgarians&mdash;hoping
to get some moral support against Bulgaria
and being prepared to offer something in return.
The Serbian attitude was sharply loyal, to stand
by Bulgaria absolutely in regard to the Turkish
frontier. Serbians have not been always popular
in Great Britain, I know; but I am not alone
among those who have come into recent contact
with Balkan affairs who found them to be the
best of the Balkan <a id="peoples"></a>peoples.</p>

<p class="p2">The Greek is even more engaging and hospitable
than the Serbian; but his fluent, flexible,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
subtle nature does not inspire full confidence.
At the outset of the last Balkan war there was one
thing that all were sure of: that the Greeks would
not fight. All were wrong. The Greeks did
exceedingly well in the field, even allowing that
they sometimes shaped their campaign quite
as much by considerations of jealousy of their
allies as of hostility to the common enemy. But
it is a fact that the Greek has usually more stomach
for politics than for fighting, and that his subtle
nature allows him to live comfortably in a state
of subjection, which would irk a more robust
mind. He is by instinct a trader: and a trader
is not an uncompromising patriot as a rule.</p>

<p>The Greeks live side by side with the Turks
in Turkey with fair comfort. At Kirk Kilisse,
after the Bulgarian occupation, a deputation
came to me from the Greeks to assure me that
they would much prefer to live under the Turk
than under the Bulgar: and asking that England
should be urged to support autonomy for Thrace.
Well, the Turks are back at Kirk Kilisse, and I
suppose my Greek friends are happy. Eloquent,
courteous, kind folk they were. I stayed in the
house of one for some days, and will remember
always the gracious kindness of the man and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
wife. I had to leave one morning at four to catch
a troop train which would carry me a few miles
towards the front. The couple were up and had
a fire and tea ready for me. As I had a fever at
the time, and a long laborious journey ahead, the
whole Greek race seemed good that morning.</p>

<p>Later at Chorlu after I had got permission
from the military commandant to go forward to
Chatalja, and he had helped me to hire a cart
and horses and to stock up my provisions, the
permission was withdrawn because Bashi-Bazouks
were raiding along the line of communication.
I might go later, he said, when a body of troops
was moving. I objected that time was precious;
and I had my revolver, and there was the driver.</p>

<p>"Ah," he said sweetly, "he is a Greek. He
will run away."</p>

<p>After that manner the Bulgarians always
spoke of the Greeks. In this case the Bulgarian
was possibly right. I finally coaxed permission
to go forward, on condition that I took a patrol
of one Bulgarian soldier, and I was allowed to
borrow a rifle and some ammunition. We met
no Bashi-Bazouks: but whilst the Bulgarian
palpably was quite content to enter into a plan
to give the Bashi-Bazouks a chance of showing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
themselves at nightfall, the Greek liked the
adventure not at all. (Perhaps on the whole
he was justified. But I was desperately eager
for a "story," and with the Turkish regulars
running away so consistently, to encounter
irregulars suggested no real danger.)</p>

<p>On that journey, at a little village which I
cannot name between Silivri and Chatalja, the
population was largely Greek. Some of the
Greeks, after the Turks had fled before the
Bulgarians, had discarded the fez and were
wearing Bulgarian caps. Others held to the
fez, but had marked on it with white chalk a
cross. I formed the opinion that if by the
fortune of war the Turks came back, those crosses
would be rubbed out. The Greek can be very
pliant undoubtedly, when he is in contact
with a dominant people. The other side to
his character&mdash;that of a hot-headed, argumentative,
boisterous Donnybrook Fair patriotism&mdash;is
developed in his own country where it is fed
with memories of the historic greatness of his
race.</p>

<p>The Roumanian&mdash;the fourth national type
in the Balkans to which I shall refer&mdash;very
closely resembles the Greek in most respects.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
Like the Greeks the Roumanians are subtle,
flexible, engaging. They are a singularly good-looking
race, and Roumanian girls are sought
after in marriage a great deal. A Serbian politician
explaining to me what he called "a nice national
balance," pointed out that the Serbians rather
despised trade and finance. The Roumanian,
therefore, came into Serbia to make money as
shopkeeper and financier. Then the young
Serbian man married the rich Roumanian's
daughter and thus the Serbian money was still
kept in the country.</p>

<p>The instinct for trade has a very marked
effect on the politics of the Balkans. The Serbian
has no love for trade: the Montenegrin despises
it quite. The Greek and the Roumanian are
very keen traders with an inclination to escape
from manual work as soon as they can. The
Bulgarian is a trader and also fond of productive
industry. So "as two of a trade never agree,"
neither Greek nor Roumanian can get on as well
with the Bulgarian as with the Serbian.</p>

<p>The Roumanian national polity differs greatly
from the Greek, though the two racial types are
very similar. Whilst Greece has a stormy and
disorderly democracy, Roumania is ruled practically<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
by an oligarchy&mdash;an oligarchy which during
the past twelve months has won to an achievement
which would have delighted the old
Florentine Republic. Without losing a soldier,
almost without spending a crown, Roumania has
won a great tract of territory and established
herself as the paramount power of the Balkans.
It was a victory of unscrupulous and patient
resoluteness which is a classic of its kind, and it
was made possible by the oligarchic system of
Roumania. The Montenegrin does not need to
be considered separately: he is the "Highlander"
of the Serbian and shares Serbian language,
customs, and character with such modifications
as the conditions of his mountain life impose.
But the Albanian, the largely Mohammedan
mountain type to which the jealousies of Europe
have agreed to give a separate nationality and
a separate kingdom, calls for some attention.
The Albanian is the wildest of the Balkan types,
and his country the most primitive. It has had
no period of civilisation, and can hardly be said
to promise to have. Its existence as a nation in
1914 was due to the fact that the German Powers
wished to have a footing in the Balkans for
intrigue. "The creation of Albania dealt a death-blow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
to the Balkan League," said a cynical
Austrian diplomatist recently. He was right: and
the creation of Albania undertaken at the instance
of Austria had no other purpose from the first,
though it was disguised under the plea of anxiety
for the national rights of the Albanians, wild
catamarans of the hills, odd specimens of whom
one may encounter in many parts of the Balkans
acting as dragomans. The Albanian has many
savage virtues. He is a picturesque fellow as he
swaggers about with a silver-decorated armoury
stuck in his waist-belt: and he is truly faithful
to a master. But he has not the barest elements
of a national organisation; and the Austrian
Prince of Albania did not find a single house
within all his dominion which would satisfy the
housing needs of a respectable London clerk.</p>

<p>Describing the march across Albania to the
Adriatic coast during the recent war a Serbian
officer wrote:</p>

<blockquote><p>It is only by travelling as we did that real facts can
be learned. We who had only known the Turks by
hearsay had a certain respect for them. At present
I feel but contempt and disgust. To think that they
should have held these lands for five hundred years,
and kept them absolutely wild and uncultivated!
Prishtina, Jakovitsa, and Prizrend are in every respect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
behind Mirigevo [a village some miles outside Belgrade].
There are neither bridges nor roads, nor decent dwellings
to be met with in the Sanjak. Of the dirt I cannot
trust myself to speak. The "Ujumat" (Prefecture)
of Prizrend, residence of the Mutessarif, is in such a
filthy condition that I could not sit there for more than
five minutes together. All around the sofras (tables)
were rags, remnants of food, tufts of dogs' hair, etc., for
these ate and slept with their masters....</p>

<p>The people are humble, cowed, moving out-of-doors
rarely, and then huddled together like a herd of cattle....
The peasants run to kiss our hands, and bow down
to the ground, but they are too frightened to give a
sensible answer to a plain question. They speak
Serbian, it is true, and cross themselves as Christians,
but otherwise bear little resemblance to our peasant
folk. They have lived no better than their masters,
for themselves and their pigs share the same apartment!
If the pigs were let loose the Turks were sure to kill
them, so they were hidden indoors. The first use they
made of the liberty we gave them was to hunt the pigs
into the open air, and how the poor beasts enjoyed it!
One could not help laughing at their antics as they
chased each other, while the children ran to keep them
from escaping to the woods. But the cows and oxen
defy description. They are like our calves, only the
shape is queer. I saw no vegetables anywhere. The
staple diet is maize. From our frontier to the sea it is the
same tale of misery, helplessness, and dirt. In Prizrend,
after every rainfall, the people drink muddy water in
which none of our soldiers would care to wash. When
we boiled it a thick scum came on the top, which we
skimmed off! This is the water used by a town of 40,000
citizens; and really one felt that authorities like the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
Turks should not be allowed to live any longer. Now
we feel that it is a disgrace to us to have delayed so long
in coming to the deliverance of our brothers in bondage
just outside our doors. Better late than never.</p>

<p>As for the independence of Albania, it would be a
comical, if it were not a sinister, idea. Whoever speaks
of a national sense in these savage hordes is either untruthful
or ignorant. The Serbians of this region make
no distinction, as we do, between the Turks and the
Mohammedan Albanians. I could not get them to
understand that the latter were in reality brethren of the
Christian Albanians with whom they live in amity. I
pointed out that these Mohammedans could not speak
a word of Turkish, but that did not help. The Serbians
insist that they are Turks all the same. And for
all practical purposes they are right. The Christian
Albanians are called by their race brethren "Catholics,"
and are hated and persecuted by them just as the Serbians
are hated and persecuted. The "Catholics" loathe
the Mohammedans and deny that they are of the same
nationality. But the fact remains that they speak the
same language. The Catholics welcomed us with joy,
rendered us every possible service, and often refused to
accept payment. They are eager to assist in our operations,
acted as scouts for us, and brought us precious
information. Sometimes they acted on their own
initiative, captured, and killed their Mohammedan
co-nationalists without first consulting us.... The
priests are the most embittered. These jealous "fratres"
told us they longed for a Christian Government, and
that the project of a united Albania was insensate....
Ismail Kemal's proclamation has irritated the priests
about here. They will not for a moment consider a
union with the Mohammedan tribes or submission to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
a Moslem leader like Ismail. On the other hand, if
we evacuate this country, a terrible fate awaits the
Catholics....</p>

<p>Here I have made acquaintance with the Montenegrin
troops, rather different from ours! They get leave to
go home and see after their wives and children whenever
they ask it, and lax discipline does not seem to affect
their heroism. They fight like lions, but do nothing
else except shoot birds and fish in the interval. Every
ship that touches here is greeted with a volley, though
ammunition is sometimes scarce, but the Montenegrin
can better spare bread than shot. He will do nothing
but fight, and ships often remain unladen here for days,
because there are few Albanians in the place to do the
work. My soldiers carry sacks and burdens of all kinds
to and from the ships, and the Montenegrins laugh at
them and say: "Is that how you fight, Brother Shumadinats?"
[Shumadia is a forest in the centre of the
Kingdom of Serbia.] They are amused to see our men
one day unshaven; they are most particular themselves
to shave each day whatever happens. The priests alone
wear a beard, for they are not supposed to fight....
The Montenegrin soldiers' wives come once a week to
look after their husbands, wash the linen, and help to
clean up....</p></blockquote>

<p>There is, of course, a certain amount of Serb
intolerance in that letter, but it represents on the
whole the truth.</p>

<p>So much for the different nations of the
Balkans. The personalities of the Peninsula
might provide a happy solution for the problems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
which the conflict of these mutually antipathetic
racial elements create: for there is no fact more
clear than that the general interest of the countries
could best be served by a wise policy of compromise
and co-operation, bringing its different elements
together as the Swiss were brought together by
a geographical rather than a racial reason. But
unfortunately there are no personalities alike
honest in outlook and great in power.</p>

<p>Four able and far-seeing men I have met in the
Balkans: M. Nikolitch, President of the Serbian
Parliament; General Demetrieff, Commander of
the Third Army (which won the most notable
Bulgarian victories), now commanding a Russian
army; M. Venizuelos, Prime Minister of Greece;
M. Take Jonescu, of the Roumanian Cabinet.
All men of power, none seemingly has sufficient
strength to impose his will not alone on his
own country, but on the other Balkan States,
and weld them into a Confederation which would
be held together by a sense of common interests
and common dangers.</p>

<p>King Ferdinand of Bulgaria has kept for years
the centre of the Balkan stage to the European
onlooker; and is still a great enough figure to
give pause to those Bulgarian Nationalists who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
would exact from him reprisal for the terrible
misfortunes of their country. But he is a man
of audacity rather than of courage, and his
ambition has been always more personal than
national&mdash;to be Czar of the Balkans rather than
to be the maker of a Balkan nation. Gifted with
a great deal of diplomatic ability and with a
soaring imagination, King Ferdinand has a
serious obstacle in his personal timidity. To
play a gambler's game one must be prepared
at times to take the great risk. But King
Ferdinand has many fears. He fears, for instance,
infectious diseases morbidly, and the thought of a
germ in the track could turn him from the highest
of enterprises. Perhaps it was the fear of disease
rather than of wounds that kept him so much in
the rear of his army during the 1912 campaign
against Turkey. But whatever the cause, his
absence from the front showed a serious weakness
of character in a man who aspired to carve out
an empire for himself. The Bulgarian authorities,
deceiving the Press almost as assiduously
for the purpose as for the false representation
that all the destruction of the Turkish forces
was ascribable to the Bulgarian arms, gave to
Europe inspiriting pictures of His Majesty following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
close on the heels of his soldiers in a military
train which served him as a palace. The fact
was that the ambitious but timid king kept very
well to the rear, at Stara Zagora first and afterwards
at Kirk Kilisse, with a great entourage of
secret police. And when armistice negotiations
were in progress he kept separate from his
Cabinet as well as from his army. Affable in
manner, industrious, pertinacious, well aware of
the advantage of advertisement (my first meeting
with His Majesty was due to the fact that he
mistook my map case for a camera, and sent
for me to photograph him while he stood on the
bridge over the Maritza at Mustapha Pasha),
of high ability, King Ferdinand did great things
for his adopted country, but showed a fatal
weakness of character when he had drunk deep
of the wine of success. It is the fashion to blame
him wholly now for the wild attack on Serbia
and Greece. He may have been in part the
victim of his advisers' folly in that. But without
much doubt he could have vetoed the fatal
move, if he had known his army from personal
observation, if he had been down to the lines at
Chatalja, and had looked closely into the besieging
forces around Adrianople. Common sense would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
have told him that the attack on his allies was
hopeless, if strength of character had not told
him that it was wicked. But he neither knew the
facts nor understood the ethics of the position.</p>

<p>General Demetrieff, Commander of the Third
Bulgarian Army, the victor of Kirk Kilisse and
of Lule Burgas, the reluctant attacker at Chatalja,
impressed me as a man of fine character. For
some few days I was a member of the officers'
mess at Erminekioi, which was the headquarters
of the Staff before the lines of Chatalja, and had
the chance of seeing much of the general. He
struck one as a frank, courageous man. He
answered questions truthfully or not at all, and
was notably kind to the very small group of
correspondents who had got through to the
front. His personal staff worshipped him, and
told with pride that most of the staff work with
him on the battle-field was under fire. When
it was clear that the attack at Chatalja had
failed, General Demetrieff neither attempted to
tell falsehoods nor shut himself off from visitors.
He ascribed the cessation of the attack to the
outbreak of cholera in the Bulgarian lines (and
the statement was probably in his mind not only
the truth but all the truth: in any case one could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
not expect him to disclose the shortage of big
gun ammunition): was avowedly disconsolate
but not in the least discouraged. I cannot imagine
General Demetrieff having any hand in the making
of the second Balkan war against the Serbians
and Greeks, and think that the Bulgarians had
in him a man of honesty and courage as well
as of great military skill. No other general of
the Bulgarian Army impressed me in the same
way, certainly not General Savoff.</p>

<p>Of the Bulgarian politicians, M. Gueshoff,
Prime Minister at the outbreak of the first war,
and M. Daneff, chief Bulgarian delegate at the
Peace Conference and Prime Minister at the
outbreak of the second war, had the chief parts
in the glories and tragedies of 1912-13. M.
Gueshoff seemed a well-meaning but weak man.
He was fond of insisting upon his English education
and of advancing that as a proof of his
complete candour. I imagine that he played
no directing part in the drama of his country's
sudden rise to power and more sudden fall, but
did just as his king directed, sometimes probably
under protest. M. Daneff was a more virile man,
and his force of character, with little guidance
from experience, of liberal education, or from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
wise purpose, had much to do with the downfall
of Bulgaria. Of the Balkan Peace Conference
which met first in London in December 1912,
M. Daneff attempted from the outset to be
dictator. He never lost a chance of being rude
to an opponent or fulsome to a supporter. He
diplomatised by pronunciamento and made a
vigorous use of the minor newspaper Press with
the idea of overawing the chancelleries of Europe.
I am sure that the British Foreign Secretary,
Sir Edward Grey, had nearly as much amusement
as chagrin from the incidents of the Conference.
Just when the Turkish delegates were
being gently coaxed up to drink the hemlock,
Bulgaria would publicly dance a wild triumph
of joy, and announce that the very last drop
had to be absorbed or Bulgaria would not be
satisfied. When the Turkish delegates were thus
startled away and all the pressure of European
diplomacy was being brought to bear upon the
Turkish Government to bring them back to the
point, Bulgaria threatened publicly to break
up the Conference and resume the war. Europe
was given a short time-limit in which to act.</p>

<p>M. Venizuelos, Prime Minister of Greece,
has proved in his own country a great capacity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
for good government and wise diplomacy. There
was a strong movement made at the outset of the
Balkan Peace Conference to have him appointed
head of the Balkan delegation. Success in that
would have made the chances of peace better;
and probably he had an expectation of being
chosen as being the senior in official rank of all
those present. But the jealousy and distrust
of Greece was great: and M. Venizuelos did not
prove himself the man of genius who could overcome
the handicap which his nationality imposed.
True, the task was almost impossible. But still
nearer to the impossible would it be now to
unite again the warring factions in the Balkans.
M. Venizuelos, of the highest talent though he
be, will not be the maker of a Balkan Confederation.</p>

<p>M. Nikolitch, President of the Serbian Parliament,
is an amiable and clever man with far
more culture than is usual in the Balkans. He
has translated English classics into the Serbian
tongue, and is an industrious student of social
and political philosophy. But he has nothing
of the brute force that is needed to control the
warring passions of the Balkan States. As the
Minister of a Balkan Union to a great Power he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
would be admirable, for he has tact and wit,
and a knowledge of the value of truth. When
it was made plain that Austria was to have her
way and Serbia no territory on the Adriatic,
the disappointment of Serbia was bitter: and
there was some special blame of Great Britain
that she "had not considered her obvious
interests," and brought this friendly little state
to the sea. M. Nikolitch had the diplomat's
faculty of taking a defeat smilingly. "The most
unhappy thing about it," he said to me, "is that
now Serbia will not have England on her frontier."
It was a neat touch to speak of the sea as British
territory.</p>

<p>There remains to be considered M. Take
Jonescu, who is credited with the chief share
in the unscrupulous diplomacy which has made
Roumania for the while paramount in the Balkans.
It was certainly a masterpiece of Machiavellianism,
applying the tenets of "The Prince" with
cold precision, and marks its author as the master
mind of the Balkans to-day. Give such a man
a good soldier people to follow him and an honest
purpose, and a Balkan Confederation might be
achieved, with some further blood-letting perhaps.
But it is not possible to believe that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
Roumanians, frivolous, pleasure-loving, untenacious,
could impose their will for long upon
the coarser-fibred but more virile Slavs of the
Peninsula.</p>

<p>No, there is not a personality in the Balkans
to-day at once forceful enough, honest enough,
and skilful enough to give the Peninsula a union
which would enable it by means of a bold decision
now to ensure internal peace and freedom from
outside interference. A great man could build
up a greater Switzerland, perhaps, of the Slavs,
the Greeks, and the Roumanians in the Balkan
Peninsula with Great Britain, Russia, and France
as joint sponsors for the freedom of the new
Federation. But one hardly dares to hope for
such a happy ending to the long miserable story
of the Balkans.</p>

<p class="center">(<i>By Post</i>, 8/-)</p>

<h3 class="high">BULGARIA. By Frank Fox.</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>This book will give to the reader an adequate idea of a wild and little-known corner of Europe, but
to those who look upon Bulgaria as a place of endless massacres and savage inhospitality the book will
bring many surprises. The Bulgarian artist shows us a land in which civilisation is evident and art not
unknown. The Australian author (who was with the Bulgarian Army as correspondent for the London
<i>Morning Post</i> during the former Balkan War) writes of a people whom he found usually courteous, gentle,
and worthy. His personal experiences of the Bulgarian peasantry are vividly interesting, and hardly
less interesting is the brief sketch of the early history of Bulgaria, the country where the Roman
Empire met its doom.</p></blockquote>

<h3 class="high">ITALY. By Frank Fox.</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Messrs. A. &amp; C. Black have published many books on the various cities of Italy with colour
illustrations. But before this they have not offered to the public a handy volume giving a general
idea of the country which was the cradle of Christian civilisation. Whether to tourists who contemplate
a visit to Italy or to those who cannot hope for that pleasure, <i>Italy</i> will be welcome. The
author has left to the vivid pictures the main task of describing Italian scenery, and devoted most of
his text to telling of the spirit of the people and showing how the Italy of to-day is linked up with the
Italy of the Roman Republic and the Italy of the Renaissance.</p></blockquote>

<h3 class="high">SWITZERLAND. By Frank Fox.</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>This volume will give to the reader a good knowledge not only of the scenery of Europe's playground
but of the Swiss people and their life. A little nation which has supplied Europe at various times with
bands of both heroes and waiters, which is celebrated alike for generous hospitality to refugees and
the most strictly commercial hospitality to tourists, has a paradoxical aspect whatever way it is regarded.
The author seeks to describe rather than to explain the Swiss, but gives a closely compressed record of
their early history as some key to the curiously contradictory elements of their national character.</p></blockquote>

<h3 class="high">ENGLAND. By Frank Fox.</h3>

<blockquote><p>The task of describing England was for good reason given to a visitor to the Mother Country. It
will be found that Mr. Frank Fox has done his work well. A stranger to England will have his
attention drawn to the features of her life which are most characteristic: residents in England will
find interest in studying an impression of their country from a sympathetic Australian observer.
Within a very small compass there is a bright living picture of England, her history, her institutions,
her people, her green country-side, her historic monuments.</p></blockquote>

<h3 class="high">FRANCE. By Gordon Home.</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Mr. Gordon Home's chapters cover many aspects of French life, and give the reader a comprehensive
vision of the land from Boulogne to Mentone and Bayonne. Political life, home life in town and country,
the duel, marriage arrangements, the navy, architecture, the doctor, the priest, the <i>midinette</i>, the
constitution, the great rivers, the watering-places, hunting, vine-growing, and school life are a few of
the many topics that come in orderly sequence in the book. After reading the volume and studying
the pictures, even those who know France well will probably understand some aspects of it more
clearly, and those who have yet to cross the English Channel will go there understanding much that
might otherwise puzzle them.</p></blockquote>

<h3 class="high">AUSTRIA-HUNGARY. By G. E. Mitton.</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>It was through Austria-Hungary that the great crisis in Europe arose. Yet how few people know
anything about the country, although both in the matter of national history and scenery Austria-Hungary
is well worth considering. Its story of romance, its scenery is not behind any in Europe,
though, except for the Tyrol and the Dolomites, it is far from well known. In the reconstruction of
political frontiers which will necessarily follow the War, the races of the Dual Monarchy will have to
be taken into account, and it is essential to know something of them if we would be abreast of the times.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
